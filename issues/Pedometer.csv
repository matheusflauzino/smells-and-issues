j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Add Russian description for Google Play,[],privet!
j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Translate Google Play description,[],"I'd like to contribute Russian translation for your Google Play application entry. Currently, it's in English https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.j4velin.pedometer&hl=ru

Can you guide me on this? I think having a file in this repo with a description written in different languages is the right way."
j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Android System thinks pedometer is running in the foreground,[],"I'm running LineageOS 15.1, Android 8.1. I updated Pedometer from v1.5.6 to v1.5.8 today. The change log of v1.5.8 reads ""add settings shortcut to notification settings on Android 8+"". Now in the settings of pedometer there is a ""Notification settings"" option, I click on this option and it will jump to the system notification settings of pedometer. 

Now the problem is, if I turn off the notification of Pedometer, the Android System will show a notification saying that ""Pedometer is using battery"". And in the battery usage information of Pedometer, the ""While in background"" entry is 0 minute, the “While in active use"" entry equals the time I unplug my phone after full charge. That is to say, though pedometer is actually running in the background, the Android System thinks Pedometer is running in the foreground (in active use) and pop up a notification notifying me of that.

I downgrade to v1.5.6 and the issue is gone. Now Pedometer is being deemed by the Android System as being running in the background again, and the ""While in background"" entry starts to grow normally. No notification of ""Pedometer is using battery"" any more. In the settings of v1.5.6, the ""Show notification"" is a check box, instead of an option that will direct me to the system notification settings of Android 8.1.

j4velin/Pedometer,open,Incorrect ,[],"For a couple of days I can see this daily behaviour:
- Steps of the day before are far too high 
- Pedometer shows Active, but remains on 0
- goal reached in X steps is higher than the fixed goal input

Next day after shutdown/reboot (Hardware Button) - the same behaviour.

"
j4velin/Pedometer,open,App occasionally records approximately 10x actual steps for a day,[],"I've been using the app for a couple of months now, and generally it works great, thank you! However, in my first week of using it and again just yesterday I had one day show up with something like 200k (not 2 million, as in one of the closed issues) steps, when I probably did about 10k. This is on a Blackberry Priv, for what it's worth. I don't have any reliable way to reproduce this, unfortunately. I didn't to the best of my knowledge do any unusual activities on the two days when this happened.

It would be nice if I could at least discard these days from my statistics, either automatically or via some kind of manual process. Perhaps there could be a user-settable cap and the number of steps per day is never allowed to be recorded as more than that? Or (more difficult, I'm sure) perhaps the average number of steps per second between readings of the hardware step counter could be calculated, and if it shows a rate above some value the reading is discarded.

If there's anything I can do to help debug this problem please let me know, and thanks very much for making the app available in the first place!"

j4velin/Pedometer,open,Notification and widget still count when pedometer is paused,[],"Hi,
Trying to figure how #116 behave. I've paused the pedometer all day. The in app counter stay still (at around 8000 after importing data) and haven't counted step since the morning but notification and widget have (around 17500 this evening).
Then when I unpaused the app, the in app counter synced with notification/widget counter and display around 17500.
I try to export data. The file report 3 steps for the current day and that was the correct value for today (the value displayed before importing data).

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,wrong total count after fly,[],"Hello,

I am using pedometer in a samsung device but I noticed counter of total summed wrong.

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Behaviour change of AlarmManager.set() since API 19,[],"Hi,

I have noticed that in SensorListener.java API [AlarmManager.set(int, long, PendingIntent)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#set(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) is used to schedule services to save the step count and restart sensor services.

According to the document, after API 19, the scheduled event will not be triggered immediately at the scheduled time and will be delayed by the operating system. After API 19, new API like setExact() and setWindow() were introduced to trigger the tasks in time.

I think it would be especially important to not use the old API when restart the sensor service. Hope this information can help.

Thx."
j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Continual achievement fix,[],"This should fix some bugs with the continual achievements. I hope I haven't done to many errors.

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,"When restoring from backup, overwrite existing days instead of skipping them",[],"Hello!

First, I love this app and I have been using it for more than a year. I like its approach of only using hardware step sensor so that it consumes no battery while still measuring steps.

I had almost no problems with it, until recently that when my device unexpectedly shutdowns, after starting up it shows an abnormal number of steps for the current day (hundreds of thousands and even millions!). It might be an old version bug, as I was running version 1.5 (I installed it through f-droid and I forgot to update it) and I have seen in the code that the unexpected shutdown recovery logic has recently been changed (it no longer displays a notification).

So, in order to remove those false step measurements, I thought to make a backup, modify the wrong step counts and then re-import it. While doing so, I realized that if the database already had data for a day in the backup file, the day was skipped from restore, favoring local database over backup.

So, I propose this change to make backup files take precedence over local data, so that we can modify the stored steps for a day without having to uninstall and the reinstall the app, loosing widgets, shortcuts and settings.

With my proposed change, when restoring data from a backup file, if the given day is already on the database, it is updated with the steps from the backup file. If it does not exists, it is created as before. I have also updated the javadoc and the associated string. But I cannot update translations (only spanish one, which I did), so we can wait for translators to update them before merging, or if that is not possible, we can remove the string in the other languages to make the user receive the english version instead of a misleading string.

Keep that good work!"

But now that I've opened the app manually and it's already a new day, it will start counting steps from 0 and work normally as expected.

I tried add this app to the white list of android battery optimization, but that didn't help. I also checked the background process of Pedometer, it seems that the SensorListener service is running normally in the background, and this app is in the white list of my task killer. So where does the problem lie? Will Pedometer get a notification saying that it's 00:00 o'clock now so it can start a new day record? Or Pedometer just maintain a timer by itself and periodically save the current number of steps? Why Pedometer doesn't start a new day record immediatelly after 00:00 until I open the app manually?

It worked as I recorded a GPS track with Osmand or while counting steps with the other app called ""Pedometer"" from F-Droid (I'm using F-Droid as the repo for effectively every app on my phone) which also keeps the phone slightly busy.

Could it be that the step detector and counter does not function in deep sleep mode on some devices?

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Steps don't make it into history,[],"My step counts have been accurately (I assume) tracked since I installed the app a little over a week ago.  But the next day, those step counts are sometimes not visible in the graph.

I installed Pedometer 1.3.3 on a Nexus 5 running Android 4.4.4.

For about a week it worked great, reporting my approximately 3-10km of walking per day as 3600-11200 or so steps, which seems about right.  My walking habits have not changed, and the counter has continued to behave correctly (AFAICT).  But the history graph has not: the graph shows (from Tuesday): 6869, 7304, 7418, 2998 (plausible; I may have taken an easy day here but I don't remember), 179 (nope), 0 (this is Sunday, which does not actually make an appearance in the bar graph, although I walked at least 7 km), and 6743 (probably correct).

Curiouser and curiouser: this morning, the values from Friday onward were all less than 200 or so (I seem to remember, but can't swear, that Sunday made an appearance at something like 1 step), and I'm not sure why the graph decided to start showing one more correct value.  I did not clear Pedometer's cache or reboot (last reboot was Monday around noon-ish), but I did export the data to a csv file, which may have been responsible for the change in display???

This looks like a duplicate of bug 40, except that those seem to have been closed.  Resurfacing of old bug or a whole new one?

I haven't looked at the code, but here are some noteworthy events around the time the bug appeared:

(1) It's been installed for a little over a week, and it seems it throws out data after that long (the bar graph is only good for a week (which is disappointing, but that's another bug)).  Is it throwing out the wrong data?

(2) My phone crashed on Saturday (I think), and I know that on a crash-and-reboot the pedometer probably won't save the steps.  But it's been failing ever since.  I rebooted in the normal way on Saturday after the crash, just in case anything was still awry.

(3) Daylight Savings time switchover happened early Sunday morning.  Confusing to the app?

(4) Sometime around Friday I calibrated my step size using the GPS (by concurrently running Runtastic) a couple of times, and changed my step size first to 92, and then to 90, cm.  Possible trigger?

Thanks!

j4velin/Pedometer,open,Automated export via Tasker,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Thanks for the app!

I would love a way to automate the export of the pedometer data. I think if you expose an intent, I can set up Tasker or some other tool to hit it so you don't have to build a whole UI around scheduling an export. I don't know much about Android development, but I poked around the AndroidManifest.xml and didn't notice any intents for exporting.

j4velin/Pedometer,closed,Consolidated the insert/update steps for simplicity.,[],"Using this method it should no longer require NewDayReceiver as we’re
always storing the most up to date steps for the current day at the
time of update.

Unless of course there’s another use for NewDayReceiver I’m not seeing
(I’ve not had a good look over the code).

The ShutdownRecevier is also VERY unreliable, what if the phone
crashes? I’m going to look at a better way of storing steps in the db
as I’ve lost steps myself from the app/phone crashing a few times.

I'm pretty sure when I woke up this AM I checked it and it was still at around 7143 rather than 0.

I'm using latest version from play store; the About link doesn't have a version number in it so I can't confirm that directly.  I'm on a Nexus 5, stock with root.
