### Steps to reproduce
 - Install OpenNoteScanner from F-Droid
 - Run ONS

### Expected behaviour
I should be asked to install OCVM after download completes.

### Actual behaviour
ONS crashes; Android prompts ""Open Note Scanner has stopped""

Depends on what I can do to debug it in the first place."

ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,Request: (default) option save black and white documents as 1-bit PNGs,[],"First of all, thank you for making OpenNoteScanner! It's a wonderful app, and I use it regularly.

However, it saddens me a bit that the output is always a high-quality JPG, even though we really have a 1-bit B&W document. In that case, it makes a lot more sense to use PNG: it's lossless (so no worries about having to use a high quality JPG setting to avoid artifacts), and actually can use a 1-bit palette for better compression.

I can't share the files I scanned because they contain sensitive personal information, but basically, I just scanned 7 black and white documents, adding up to 8MiB JPGs.

After opening the files in GIMP, setting the colors to 1-bit black and white (no dithering) and re-exporting them as PNGs the total size was a mere 445 KiB, a 20x decrease in size without any loss in quality! And note how this whole process can be automatic.

Now, I know PNG encoders can be slow, but if you tell it to turn off [filtering algorithms](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Filters.html) they usually get a lot faster (because they basically try compressing with different filters and keep the best option, leading to more work). Those filters are mostly for dealing with documents that have a lot of gradients, something that is absent in B&W images by definition, so there isn't really a big compression benefit to using them here anyway."

In the source code the old ""Camera Api"" is used which is deprecated from android api 21. It will be best if you integrate ""Camera2 Api"" aswell."

App-behavior: Camera works, I can see the green outline once I turned automatic document detection on. The green button on the bottom tells me:
""Searching for document

Nothing else happens. Tried with preformated PDF, normal paper, tapping the green region, aso.
When I tap the green button again, the Image the image gets scanned, turned into contrast view, but no perspective-correction happens.

its very annoying, trying scanning a vast among of documents as fast as i can, and often the app crashes, has to be restarted, sometimes even black responce, have wipe from the bottom side of the screen to show otherwise hidden android menu, press back, start again. Here is some logcat output, hopefully youll be able to fix that.

> There was an error posting your comment: Body is too long (maximum is 65536 characters)

so here it is as attachment. Even tho every modern system should detect utf8 textfiles without this antique filename suffixes with an .txt behind that. thanks github for being not modern.

i was unable on android 7 to select external storage (sd card). My device has internal storage to save photos etc and external (fat formated) sd card. I tried to enter the full path but it created on the internal storage an cryptic named directory that is even invisible on normal file manager and under that all the rest of the phath insted of going from the root.

This is how it looks like from my computer:

```
mtp://[usb:xxx,yyy]/Interner%20gemeinsamer%20Speicher/%E3%84%80%E3%9C%80%E3%80%80%E3%9C%80%E3%88%80%E3%84%80%E5%90%80%E3%84%80%E3%88%80%E3%94%80%E3%9C%80%E3%8C%80%E3%80%80/storage/0123-4567/opennote
```
(changed identifiers of device and sdcard filesystem)

and on the device this directory is invisible at all...

Please add a possibility to write on external memory on android 7.

thanks.

ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,"Adapt ""Share"" intent from gallery to the number of selected documents",[],"The sharing button from the gallery view would always create an intent to share _multiple_ pictures, even when only one document is selected (issue #78).

Add a check for the number of selected documents: if there is only one, an intent to share only one picture is created. Thus, the same list of applications is displayed as in the full screen view.

This makes the behavior more consistent with the sharing button from the full screen view, and make it easier to export a scanned document from the gallery to other applications, e.g. PDF Creator."
ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,Inconsistent share target between views,[],"The list of ""Share"" targets shown when hitting the button from the gallery view, is different from the list of targets available from the full screen scan view. In particular, the application [PDF Creator](https://github.com/scoute-dich/PDFCreator) does not show up (but it is not the only one, just the one that made me realize this issue).

As ""Sharing"" scans to PDF Creator can be really useful for PDF export, I believe it is important to fix this, because this bug prevents exporting multiple scans at once into a single PDF.

I can't say for sure that the problem does not actually come from the applications that do not appear in the ""Share"" targets of the gallery view."
ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,Deleting the last image from gallery didn't close the activity.,[],"After deleting the last image, a empty image was displayed (white screen) instead of going back to the gallery. Pressing either **Delete** or **Tag** resulted in _IndexOutOfBoundsException_.

ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,(Colored) areas converted to (colored) edges,[],"Thanks for this great app! I'm really excited after finding it today. However, I noticed the postprocessing does some edge detection and this isn't a good solution for some (many?) notes as it loses colored areas by converting colored areas into just colored edges. Why is edge based postprocessing done?

Here's a scan without processing:

![without processing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2195834/26886553-5301a2d0-4bae-11e7-8e0e-6aa755da2394.jpg)

All the colored areas are lost and even the edges are hardly visible. Would it be possible to either offer an option to disable edge based postprocessing or disable it globally altogether?  I really would love to see a colored area as a colored area instead of just the edges of the area."

ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,open,Inefficient API is used,[],"Dear developers,

I found an inefficient API, setImageURI(), is used in OpenNoteScanner.

For setImageURI(), Google says this:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html#setImageURI(android.net.Uri)
"" This does Bitmap reading and decoding on the UI thread, which can cause a latency hiccup. If that's a concern, consider using setImageDrawable(android.graphics.drawable.Drawable) or setImageBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap) and BitmapFactory instead. ""

I noticed that in the following code, setImageURI() is used:
com.todobom.opennotescanner.views.TouchImageView.java   (line number: 181)
https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/todobom/opennotescanner/views/TouchImageView.java

Do you think the use of setImageURI() will affect OpenNoteScanner's performance? If so, maybe we should move Bitmap reading and decoding to a background thread.

Thanks.

I like this app because I can use as camera replacement for scanning documents but for that purpose I find the post processing on images to be super aggressive such that most of the images I take with it are not even readable at all, fonts are gone, images are gone etc. I even tried the color mode, but that just gave the same result as the bw mode not sure if it is buggy.  I tried the auto on off without any success.

Anyways it would be great if one could levrage the level of the processing a bit.If people want super auto mode that is fine but I personally like to use this to scan documents, receipts, napkin notes etc

The Google Play banner would be nice to improve too. The official size is 1024 x 500 px and it would be featured on the initial page of the project too.

That results in non-rectangle shapes, that could maybe be detected and corrected?

ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner,closed,Won't capture images ,[],"Hi. I'm a big fan of camscanner so when I saw you had a FOSS app that did something similar I was super excited.

I have a Sony Xperia Z1 compact with Android 5.11 - stock rom.

I installed v1.0.10 OpenNoteScanner from f-droid, and let the app install openCV manager from google play. When I launch the app I get the camera preview, I can toggle the buttons on the right, but I can't capture anything. I have tried tapping the blue shutter icon and the screen, and the feedback indicates it registers taps, but nothing happens. 

Any ideas? 

Thanks
