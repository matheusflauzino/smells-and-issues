gsantner/markor,open,$x$ gives block equation instead of inline equation,[],"This is broken by the recent changes regarding math block rendering. $x^2$ should give an inline equation (that's how it works in latex and typora), and it used to work this way in markor before 1.4.0. Now, it gives a block equation."
gsantner/markor,open,Problems receiving file intents (several apps),[],"#### General information

* **App version:**  1.4.0
* **System:** Pixel 2 (stock Android 9)

#### Description

I'm having problems with consistent and reliable file sending into Markor, I've tried to reproduce this in several ways with different sending apps. In general, it feels like Markor has trouble receiving file intents sometimes, while other editors can receive them fine. I'm not sure where the bugs lie, I realize that they may be with the other apps so just trying to gather information.

I first added [Editor](https://github.com/billthefarmer/editor), a very basic open source editor which seems to receive the file intents from all the below OK (except LabCoat) as an A / B test against Markor at the same time.

  - When I email a file `test.md` to my phone as an attachment and open it in the stock GMail app, the only option to open the file as a share or save is Editor - Markor doesn't even register as a receiver from GMail for *.md it appears?
  - Saving `test.md` to Downloads, then using the ""Files"" app (built-in basic file app that comes with Android9/Pixel2) when choosing ""Open with..."" the option for Markor is not present, but Editor is (as well as FX Textedit and FX Text Viewer, part of FX File Manager app)
  - Using [Green Git Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.jhutil.ggc) I can clone a project with MD files, navigate to them and attempt to open the file. The file opens straightaway in Editor, but when choosing Markor I get an error about the file not being sent correctly - [`filemanager_doesnot_supply_required_data__appspecific`](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/gsantner/markor/activity/DocumentActivity.java#L121) code path. As the Editor source is also open, this was a very good A / B test - Markor _should_ be able to receive the same file as Editor did?
  - Using [LabCoat](https://gitlab.com/Commit451/LabCoat) results in the same error as above about missing file intent data, however this app does not let me choose which app to launch when editing (it always just launches Markor). This project has a lot of bugs open, this may be on their end since I can't test an alternate app (Editor) against it so this one is dubious

The only counter-example of ""seems to work right"" is when using [FX File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx), however this app uses a different method than most others (you have to choose ""Open as..."" then select a MIME type `text/plain`, then choose the app to receive - both Markor and Editor receive the file intent fine this way). This app is not open source and has different behaviour traits - interesting, but maybe not useful for this debugging.

Perhaps if nothing else, figuring out why another open source editor (Editor) receives the file intents OK from ""GMail"" and ""Files"" stock Android/Google apps would be a clue as to what's going on with Markor's basic file-opening issues. Green Git Client doesn't seem to have source to look at yet (it's alpha), but is an interesting ""why doesn't this work either with Markor?"". LabCoat's source seems like they copied it from another project so it's an outlier here. Thanks for listening!"

Hi!
Adding a new format option (like markdown / todo.txt / plaintext is), like VCard.

- With possibility to create duplicate of this type of note. ( to use the same set of keys ) . Or suggest in a new note, existing keys, stored in others note."
gsantner/markor,closed,Feature request: Markdown improvements,[],"Hi, these are some additions to the markdown rendering that would be nice:

1. **syntax highlighting:** for code fences when a language is specified
2. **markdown todo checklists:** being able to tick and untick the task checkmark (same as on vscode)
3. **CSS themes included:** appreciate the ability to add custom markdown CSS but if you make changes to it when using several devices can be troublesome. The default CSS lacks some basic formatting such tables and inline code blocks (although the font is changed to monospace) which means you need to add them manually. It would be easier if the app in addition to the custom CSS has several predefined complete markdown themes you can choose from and preferably be able to switch between them, for example from a list.
4. **inject CSS from a file:** being able to add custom CSS by selecting local CSS theme file

One last request, not markdown related:

5. **hide windows:** being able to show hide windows (Notebook / ToDo / Quicknote)

Big thanks to everyone working on this wonderful and probably the best notetaking project for mobile. On a side note - please take some inspiration form [simpletask](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android), they still manage todo.txt handling better.

This is my first post (issue) in GitHub. I opened a GitHub account just to request some features!!!
Your app is really a great app.
One of the best.

_Please consider adding some of the features mentioned below..._

- 1 - search option will also search inside notes. Not only the name of the notes.

- 2 - some more markdown features/options... (At least for Todo list)

- 3 - ability to add sub tasks using marking options in tasks.

- 4 - ability to add description inside a task.

_Some more if you can..._

- 5 - browsing folders through sidebar (exploring folders in sidebar like a tree view)
This can be included in ""themes"" option so user can choose what style he want.

- 6 - file browser in markor app will show ""custom summary""/""1st few lines""/any other useful thing instead of ""last opening date""... Aaaannnnddd ""only file name"" mode too.. if anyone wants that..

- 7 - markor quick note as a popup. User can surf internet and take notes!!!!

- 8 - native tasks support... What i mean by that....---> sidebar will have specified place/section for tasks.
You can add folders to better organize your tasks. 

- 9 - In Each folder, you add tasks (with subtasks and notes) just like a native todo list app. (Like ticktick or todoist with description) It will feel like that. And the data of those folders will be saved in a certain txt file.
I think i cant fully express myself. :( Sorry for my bad English. he folders in sidebar Todo section are actually a txt file. Just like other notes. 

- 10 - I don't want to make individual txt file for individual tasks. It will be messy. But we keep same kind of things (related things) in a folder, right? Thats why i want a todo list folder to be one txt file. Example-
""To do after xm"" folder will contain many tasks/todos. They will be stored in ""To do after xm.txt"" but will be shown as a task list with ""task complete"" checkbox, priority based color/highlighting system, A-Z/custom orientation of tasks, tapping a tasks will open description/subtasks etc etc.

- 11 - Just check out any todo list app and you will clearly understand what i am trying to tell you (specially ticktick, please)  So it will be like ""one app for all your tasks and notes"" 😎 including both interface- note taking and todo list style in one place, in this lightweight apk!!!!
People will be crazy for this app 😬

- 12 - sd card support...

- 13 - it is nice to see all notes made with markor is actually txt files and real folders. It would be great if it could sync to Google drive in exactly same manner (same file structure under a certain root folder set by user)

Ummm i have these features requests.. Can't think of something more now.
I love your app!!! This app has great potentials
I think you will consider my requests.
I know coding will take time. I will be waiting for these features in future update.
Best wishes for you all."

Nice to see markor supporting Tex / KaTeX syntax for math, however I noticed that the 'block' syntax for equations, i.e. the $$ delimiter does not work.

The text between the '$$' delimiters should be rendered as math, centered and with a larger font. Currently $$ is interpreted as empty in-line math section and thus does nothing.

For a test case, see e.g. the 'Examples/block' section here: https://github.com/waylonflinn/markdown-it-katex/blob/master/README.md

The target is to have an TextAction (a button in the bottom bar) which opens a new **dialog** with features below:
* Selection of a date/timeformat, with some default options like `hh:mm`, also there should be an EditText so the user can do an own custom format. (resulting from #260)
* Show below all formats what would be result at the current time object
* Have an button to show an date/timepicker which allows you to select a different time than the current time object. So you could select 05:00 in the timepicker, and then press `hh:mm:ss` as format and you get `00:05:00` inserted into text.
* Add on very bottom a checkbox which changes insertion to text. When checked insert the format string. When not (default) then insert the formatted time (what you get from `SimpleDateFormat.format(dateObject..)`. (resulting from #374)"

gsantner/markor,open,TextAction: Add voice to note (audio recording),"[Label(name=""feature""), Label(name=""good first issue""), Label(name=""hacktoberfest""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","#### Description
Often spoken is the easiest way to take notes. It would be great to just be able to press a microphone button and a start/stop audio recording thing popup. 

Target of this:
* Create new audio recording button
* Popup dialog which has options for start/stop and cancel
* Save recorded audio in same folder as current document
* Add filename to current cursor position in text

### Suggestion
What I liked greatly so far is [this project](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6797), which basically resolves most important points. Sadly it doesn't allow set save paths. But as 99% of the important things is done [in a single file](https://github.com/IvanSotelo/RecordDialog/blob/master/recorddialog/src/main/java/com/deskode/recorddialog/RecordDialog.java) I think the best option is to copy/fork the file and adapt it to Markor needs. We don't need stuff like Hangouts ringetone when pressing start or fancy start animation for example:-).

Currently when the user has placed the cursor inside a link he can click the ""open in browser"" action to open it externally. I would like to have something similar to fastly show the picture under the cursor.

Todo:
* Add new dummy textaction, run it from textactionbar on bottom
* Reuse logic from ""open in browser"" in CommonTextactions to extract image path
* Show picture in a fullscreen dialog on pressing the textaction in bottom bar

* Extract all image paths inside the current document and show swipeable gallery of all pictures in the current document
* Start the swiping list with the nearest image from cursor position"

* **App version:**  v1.2.2
* **System:** Android 7.0.1

#### Description
Currently Markor always does open an external browser when clicking on something that is not a filepath (in browser) or using the ""open link"" textaction.
It would be nice to use the ""Chrome Custom Tabs"" feature to show links, which allows to much faster view contents. Reference to docs (many guides and blogs posts available which shows howto too): <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/customtabs/package-summary> /  <https://developers.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs>

This is also already done in another project of mine, [dandelion*](https://github.com/gsantner/dandelion) where you can too find some hints. Important is that this does not only work with Chrome, but also Firefox/Fennec (which implements the interface too). Be sure to specify their package id's and that should work.

#### Description
I recently worked on some electronics related documents and found out that I can't type OHM (Ω) somehow with my touch keyboard. Hence I then opened browser, found the symbol and copied it.
It would be great to have an dialog popping up which shows special characters with a possible short symbol name, so search works. 
What's my favourite so far is how LibreOffice has this implemented, you can use that as a reference whats possible and see visually what this is about. You can use the existing SearchOrCustomDialog class if you want, the first and biggest part is to populate the list (get symbol + it's name).

* **App version:** v1.2.0
* **System:** 7.1.1

#### Description
Currently I'm using an external [tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) on both desktop and mobile to edit markdown tables (to be honest it gets unpracticable when there are more than 1 word + 3 cols).

The target is to add a TextAction, which allows to edit a table. When there is an existing table under cursor it needs to be analyzed and filled into the table editor.

The table editor is supposed to be some kind of Dialog, fragment or View, but no Actvivity. It has to work without leaving current activity(=editor). 

Features for the table editor itself have not to be big, its basically enough if you can add&remove columns&rows, and enter text (no highlighting needed!).

Steps:
1. Make code to get NxM array out of an existing table. Try it on Commonmark and GFM tables.
2. Make scrollable UI to show the table
3. Add buttons to add/remove cols/rows
4. Make cells editable
5. Implement insertion of edited result, replace existing table if one was preselected

**Notice:** This feature is free to take and will not be developed by the team."

Currently, we need to hit enter and delete the last 2 characters to exit a list or go down, create a new line, and go back up.

In some markdown software, hitting enter after an empty item (i.e. hitting enter twice from the current item) will remove the empty item (typically without creating a new line) instead of the current behavior of creating yet another empty item. This makes it quick and easy to 'exit' a list. I would like that functionality in Markor."

* **App version:** v1.1.2
* **System:** Android 7.1.1

#### Description
The goal is to add a new format option (like markdown / todo.txt / plaintext is), which has actions and highlighting for a time tracking format. At the current point it's unclear (or no favourite) which format should be implemented, but these are the rough points/requirements that should be doable:
* Simple and lightweight format, fits into one file
* As always, it's a textfile format, enter description etc, by freely editing text. A separate view/UI is not wanted. Dialogs are okay, as always.
* best if _one line = one time track entry_
* Multiple projects
* Quick press start which starts a new task, you can always enter description later
* Actions which popup a dialog, which do show how much work you did this day/week/month/year. Selection between overall and all projects.

## Research
So the first part is research, to find out what is available, best if there are existing clients and java-libraries available for given format/standard. 
If not much results are available, it's suggested to go for an extended kind of `todo.txt`. To use Start/end date and add times as `key:value` pairs that is shown in standard also. Things like projects and context are already available in this format."

gsantner/markor,closed,Maybe I could help with this small feature?,[],"## Why am I writing this?

I tested you app @gsantner  today and I loved it. I would love to help.  I have little expierence in Android development, but I will learn it no problem.  First feature I would like to implement is the ability to add prefix to every todo item in `todo.txt`.  Secondly it would be nice for it to support GFM todo lists for example:

```markdown
- [ ] Task that is not done.
- [x] Task that was done.
```
Also I liked your idea for prioritization (A), (B) ... clean and simple.  So new todo syntax would look like:

```markdown
- [x] (A) This is a completed high priority task
- [ ] (B) This is an uncompleted high priority task
```

Furthermore I believe that `- [x] ` sequence is to verbose, so maybe the rendering engine could support `[x]` for marking todo items?

If anyone thinks they would find this feature useful express your thoughts and ideas below.

gsantner/markor,closed,single-document-revisioning support,[],"#### General information
re v 0.3.10(24) running on android 6.0.1

#### Description
Feature request for improved revisioning support, initially mentioned in issue #302  

recap: After spending a few hours creating/ editing an important file (with my boss!) I hit a key combination that deleted all contents, irrecoverably. I'm hoping to see the implementation of some method(s) to mitigate this sort of (huge) problem. 

@gsantner suggested (in the closed issue #302) that supporting a single-document-revisioning scheme would be ok. .. and so I post this issue, hoping to cause a mild case of developer itch, even though I know didly about said s-d-r :)

As well, or alternatively, a session-based ""revert-all-changes"" button, might serve as a safety-net of last resort, and not to pile too many ideas into a single Issue, but perhaps a ""save version"" option could be used in conjunction with the existing Save button?

Again, thanks for the consideration and the awesome app.

gsantner/markor,closed,Add option to take photo and insert it's markdown link (#306 -> #319),[],"Addresses issue #306 
#### Description of the solution and bug

The text module actions are added to the bottom `ViewGroup` (in the `DocumentEditFragment`) in the `MarkdownTextModuleActions` class. `onClick` listeners are attached to each button added. So I added an icon to take a photo and insert it's link at the location of the cursor. 

To call the camera activity and get it's result, we need to use the `startActivityForResult` function which is a member function of `Activity` and `Fragment`. I called the `DocumentActivity`s `startActivityForResult` as the `MarkdownTextModuleActions` class already has a `_activity` member referring to the activity. This is supposed to start the camera activity and call the `onActivityResult` function in `DocumentActivity` on exit of the camera activity (but while debugging using the Android debugger i noticed that the `DocumentEditFragment`'s function is being called). Since it is logical to handle this result in the `MarkdownTextModuleActions` class, i am calling the `DocumentEditFragment`'s `onActivityResult` which in turn calls another method (also called `onActivityResult`) of the `MarkdownTextModuleActions` object. 

Now, if the picture is taken the `url` is inserted using `_hlEditor.getText().insert(...)`. I checked using the Android debugger that this particular statement is being executed on taking a picture but no text is getting inserted. On the other hand the snackbar is being shown when no picture is taken. I have noticed that the cursor position in the editor is being reset to the start of the text when the camera activity returns.

gsantner/markor,closed,Allow spaces in markdown links,[],This enables the space-in-links support of flexmark-java to support spaces in markdown links (especially relevant for filenames). See #317.
gsantner/markor,closed,Vimwiki support,[],"I currently manage my notes on the desktop using vim with the [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) plugin. It uses a very simple structure: a bunch of markdown files in a folder (flat structure, no subfolders). One of those files in `index.md` and is the starting point. Other files are linked from there. I've looked for an app to edit this on my phone for a while and Markor looks very promising. For basic vimwiki support I think two things are missing:

- an option to open `index.md` by default instead of launching in the folder view
- support for links in the two formats ([for
  reference](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/issues/318#issuecomment-290600538))
	- `[[some file]]` which equivalent to `[some file|some file.md]` and
	- `[text|some file]` which is equivalent to `[text|some file.md]`

Vimwiki also offers a ""diary mode"" which is basically just a seperate wiki with some convenience functions to quickly create new files with the current date as the name. Support for that would also be nice but supporting the above two features would already go a very long way to support basic editing on the phone.

#### Description
Many thanks for this app. I have been using it to convert some previously text-only documents I've created into Markdown documents.

However, I've found some rendering problems in the editor when Syntax highlighting is turned on. I haven't been able to boil this down to a simple example, but I attach a (redacted) typical file, and some screenshots of the problem. This is happening to almost any previously text-only file I try to convert to Markdown. Note that they render fine in preview mode, just not in the syntax highlighting editor.

Please note that the filename actually ends in .md - I only changed it to .txt so that github would accept it.

gsantner/markor,closed,Root considerations,"[Label(name=""wait/maybe/upstream""), Label(name=""wontfix"")]","Hi @gsantner 

in #290 you say:

> You can use root permission to edit them (to dangerous!), somehow rely on a system app to get somehow access, maybe some dirty hacks or hidden APIs to get access. I don't want to do that, none of them.

This is certainly your right and you also make some good arguments for it.  You might also, however, consider the following: most people who use a markdown editor probably have some significant IT ""chops"" and know the potential pitfalls of root access.

You initial ""solution"" to the write-to-SD card seems to be a good step in the right direction (at least it makes the program's limitations more transparent).  I look forward to testing the next version of Markor.

Also, FYI -- closing a thread to persons who have previously commented on a thread is probably counterproductive in that you may see new threads like this one.

gsantner/markor,closed,feature request: file encryption,[],"I would love to see any method of encryption implemented.  Either universal password in settings to be used for all encrypting and then just pick to ""save as encrypted"" and have anything encrypted auto opened with the password in settings.
Or a way to use open key chain to encrypted and decrypted notes internally not by sharing the text."
gsantner/markor,closed,Feature Request: enable choosing automatic RTL/LTR text direction in preview setting,[],"Settings has a boolean option under preview section for RTL rendering. I think  there should be an option for `dir=auto` option just like in HTML.
Most bilingual users which write in RTL languages such as Hebrew and Arabic write sometimes in English as well.

Thanks for a wonderful app BTW."
gsantner/markor,closed,Markor can not write or change the file to a SD memory card,[],"#### General information

* **App version:** Markor 0.3.10 (24)
* **System:** Android 6.0.1 and 7.0

#### Description

Markor can not write or change the file to a SD memory card `/storage/xxxx-xxx/_test.md`.
Changing the file to internal memory `/storage/emulated/0/_test.md` is normal.
For me this is a big problem.

Please see https://imgur.com/a/dyI6mnj  . I'm clicking on three files and nothing opens, than I'm clicking on ""new file"" button and you can see I get a slightly different screen (the toolbar shows up at the bottom of the screen)."
gsantner/markor,closed,Incompatibility with images added with other editors,"[Label(name=""invalid/duplicate"")]","#### General information

-   **App version:** 0.3.10 (24)
    
-   **System:** Android 8.1.0
    

#### Description

I don't know how to explain the issue so I'm gonna take an example. 

For an image called ""i like apples.png"", Markor will save the image with the path ""./folder/i&20like&20apples.png"" _(which work well in Markor)_.

However, in most Markdown editor, there's no ""&20"" instead of the space, so Markor doesn't show the picture, which leads to an incompatibility when using multiple Markdown editors.

It will be great if Markor will be able to show images, even If it doesn't have been inserted in Markor.

Here's an example. The first image has been added with another Markdown editor (Mark Text), and the second one was added with Markor.

gsantner/markor,closed,Seperator based on setting,[],"#### Description
Add options for Markdown syntax, Plain syntax, LinkBox special file, ToDo syntax, that allow to specify text to be appended.

Also allow to specify some variables/dynamics. A Jekyll user may know liquid date syntax, which I do prefer for resolving this.

 Currently this is:

* Date:  `{{ date: ""dateformat"" }}`
* May be extended. date most important

For ToDo use as default: `{{ date: ""dateformat"" }}`

Replaces: #259 #284 #286"
gsantner/markor,closed,Remove separator when sharing to linkbox and todo,[],"Like I said in my issue #284, I think the linkbox should be an textfile with one link  per line.
You don't need a separator, because the link is a one-liner and so line-ending separates.

This also make the linkbox good for scripting, for example, on my linux machine, I pipe the
file into dmenu to give me a link-selector :smile:

You already made an exception when sharing to todo file, to add no ruler.
But I think there should also be no empty line before the new entry.
In the [Example](http://todotxt.org/todo.txt) from [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) you kann see
one entry per line without empty lines.

This is just my opinion about this issue. If you think different, please tell me.
I would like to discuss.

#### Description

I have a md file which links to a picture taken in portrait mode but when previewing it in Markor it's in landscape mode. 

If I take the html output of the md file, add the following CSS property to the html header and open it in PC browser, the picture is shown in portrait mode correctly.

```
<style> img { image-orientation: from-image; } </style>
```

So I injected the same CSS property in Markor hoping to get the same result but unfortunately it's not doing anything. Is this because Markor doesn't support this particular CSS property?

#### Description
When opening a document from the list, then closing it, list jumps to the start. Best explained by an example: Imagine I have 100 documents in a folder, the first being `Anchor.md`. Now I open `Notes_Mary.md`, read/edit, and close it again. File list has jumped back to `Anchor.md` (the first document) again, but I wanted to cross-check with `Notes_Peter.md` – so I have to scroll through the list a lot.

#### Suggested behavior
When closing the document, the list still remains at the place/position where the just document (in above example: `Notes_Mary.md`) was opened from. _Optionally,_ there could be a floating button (or something else) to ""jump to top"".

gsantner/markor,closed,Share into Quicknote/To-Do/Clipboard,[],"Looking for a suitable Markdown editor/notebook, I found your project. Before I install it, I'd like to have a little clarification. The documentation mentions:

> Share into QuickNote - Pocket/Read-it-Later alternative

There are hundreds of apps going by the name of ""QuickNote"" – but I couldn't find any that would work as a RiL alternative. Could you please clarify (link) which one you mean?

I have the vague guess that you rather mean something along the lines of ""share from any other app to Markor's QuickNote feature, which can serve as a local RiL alternative"". If that's what it means, the description is a bit misleading – as Pocket is a service collecting your ""notes"" so you can read them from any device (including browser integration).

Similarly:

> Share into To-Do - Wunderlist alternative
> Share into Clipboard - without a seperate clipboard app

The addendum ""without a separate clipboard app"" on the last entry is what brought me to the guess you're talking about internal features of Markor.

If my guess is right, maybe the description should be slightly altered to avoid such confusion?

> Share into *Markor's* QuickNote as a Pocket/Read-it-Later alternative
> Share into *Markor's* To-Do as a Wunderlist alternative
> Share into *Markor's* Clipboard - without a separate clipboard app

Whichever way, it's no show-stopper – but would be really helpful when comparing apps (though if the list of requirements contains ""must be available on F-Droid"", there's only one other candidate left for me anyway :wink:)

The file in question is 9,000 words long though this has also occurred with relatively smaller files.  

Since taking notes is my primary use for Markor and my notes tend to run long, this gets in the way a lot.

What further information can I provide?

I'm attaching a screenshot of the crash message.

#### Description

Hi, when you have multiple hard-break lines of text and highlight them all, then use one of the List elements from the format toolbar the result is only the first line getting the `- ` added to it in front. The expectation would be that on each new line start (hard line break), all lines are formatted as `- ` list elements. Well, that's my expectation at least. :) Thank you!

Visually:
```
one
two
three
four
```
Highlight/select all lines, use unordered List button, result:
```
- one
two
three
four

gsantner/markor,closed,Feature: Alternative main-navigation using navdrawer,"[Label(name=""feature""), Label(name=""wait/maybe/upstream"")]","#### General information

* 0.3.7
* Android 8.1

#### Description

Currently the main navigation has a ribbon at the bottom with Notebook/To-Do/Quicknote/More. It feels weird with modern Android UI, most applications use a ""hamburger"" menu in the upper left, when clicked it pops out a left-drawer with nav items. I believe Markor will look and feel nicer if converted to this style, it ""fits"" for this kind of app. (the same design used with the GMail app for example)

If the main screen Nav is moved to the hamburger drawer method, this also allows more space for menu items to be placed in it (Settings, Help, Rate, etc.) which currently don't fit on the ribbon on the bottom (More...), so besides feeling nicer it would have a functional benefit. :)

Thank you for making the app!

* **App version: v0.3.6 (20), Google Play** 
* **System: Android 7.0** 

#### Description

Problem: When linking to another Markdown page whose name contains a Unicode character (like diacritics), it does not open the intended page, and creates a new blank page instead. This issue also occurs for any page located within a directory whose name contains a Unicode character. This can be a serious problem for users who title their pages in non-English languages (e.g. Chinese, Spanish) and want to link to these pages from other Markdown pages.

What should happen: It should open the intended page instead of creating a blank page.

gsantner/markor,closed,Files not visible through MTP,"[Label(name=""invalid/duplicate"")]","#### General information
 - App version: 0.3.4 (installed through F-Droid)
 - System: Sony Xperia X Compact, Android 8.0.0

#### Description
When keeping the defaults, Markor will store files in /storage/emulated/0/Documents/markor/ . These are visible in Android's builtin file manager (""Dateien"" App), but not through MTP, the ""Documents"" folder simply does not seem to exist.

When deleting the folder, creating it through MTP, and putting a few *.md files into them, Markor *does* see them, and editing them causes the files to get changed correctly. But after that, when creating a new note (or todo.txt or whatever), that particular file is again not visible through MTP. It is like Markor-created files have a special flag/owner/whatever that hides them from MTP.

I also tried to point Markor's storage path to the SD card (a path like /storage/1234-5678/Dokumente/markor/), which I would actually prefer for easier syncing. But with that, Markor seems unable to create or edit *anything* in that folder, any document creation simply goes into the void without error message.

I wonder if that is just me, or reproducible by someone else on a different model?"

gsantner/markor,closed,Quick note save button is not working properly in landscape mode,"[Label(name=""wontfix"")]","
#### Expected behavior
As app keeps the save button disabled if i didn't write anything in quick note yet, so when i write some text in my quick note then the save button needs to be enable so that i can save my quick note.

#### Actual behavior
When i run app in landscape mode and go to quick note section to write a note. As my note is empty yet so the save button is disabled which is fine but after writing one line, the save button is still disabled. I wait for around 5 minutes but the button didn't enable. But if i go to another tab and came back to quick note tab then the button enables(for better understanding please see recording of bug).

#### How to reproduce
To reproduce the bug follow the following steps :-
- Open the app and rotate your screen to landscape mode.
- Now go to quick note tab to write a note. As you go you see the save button at top bar is in disabled condition now.
- Write a word or line and the button is still disabled.
- Now switch to any other tab and came back to quick note tab again and you see now the save button is disabled.

#### Expected behavior
I expect a specific function when i tick **hide status bar** in the main view. A function that renders the status bar immediately invisible when you navigate back to the main view

#### Actual behavior

The app has no status bar, however the tool bar at the bottom of the main view remains visible regardless of you ticking it hidden

#### How to reproduce
* download the app from fdroid store
* launch app and allow permissions if prompted
* Click on the settings icon, the third icon at the top tool bar
* Click on **main view**
* Now scroll down to more and tick the **hide status bar** check box
* Go back to the main view by clicking the arrow at the top left corner, click till you are at the main view. Down below is the imminent status or tool bar, still very visible

gsantner/markor,closed,"Resources section in more tab hidden/inaccessible, when run app in landscape mode.",[],"
#### Expected behavior
If i go to more tab in app and change device orientation from portrait to landscape, then the app needs to manage it's layout according to screen orientation so that user can access all features of app in landscape mode too.

#### Actual behavior
If i go to more tab in app and change device orientation from portrait to landscape, then resource section got cut out of the screen and become inaccessible even the whole section get disappeared. First i think that may be developer hides this section on landscape mode, so i test this bug on another device and on that device only Resources section heading is showing, other part is cut out from layout and hidden.

#### How to reproduce
To reproduce the bug follow the following steps :-
- Open the app and go to more tab of app.
- Now you see in portrait mode you can access all the parts including resources section.
- Now change screen orientation from portrait to landscape and resources section got hidden and become inaccessible.

gsantner/markor,closed,Use external card as storage for Markor files?,[],"#### General information

* **App version:** 0.3.4
* **System:** Android Marshmallow 6.01

#### Description
I may be missing the obvious.

I just installed Markor on a 10"" tablet.  Markor claims Notebook is in /storage/emulated/0/documents/markor.  Attempts to muse that bomb with an Error: can't create notebook directory.  Similar errors occur trying to use the Quicknote and To-Do functions.  (I've seen similar problems elsewhere - my device has some odd permissions notions, and I've been unable to root it and fix that.)

I'd *like* to have Markor read from and write to a directory on my external microSD card, but there seems to be no way to specify that as a location.

Am I missing the obvious?  If it's not possible, I think it ought to be.  As it stands, I can't actually use Markor on this device.

Thanks in advance.

Might it be useful also for other people to have a button on the toolbar to add two spaces at the end of the current line? Maybe the cursor doesn't have to be at the end of the line. And maybe the app can check whether there are already two spaces to prevent extra spaces being added.

This could also be implemented for list items.

This could be added to the editing mode (where it would be of most use, especially in large files), and perhaps also in the preview mode. (The latter could be complex to implement, though, and may bring in its own set of problems.)

gsantner/markor,closed,Plugin system,"[Label(name=""feature""), Label(name=""wait/maybe/upstream"")]","Markor seems to steadily be gaining features. It's good to see it grow - especially as it remains the **only** freedom-respecting mobile text editor which stores data in plain text files by default (no exporting needed), which permits syncing (with Syncthing, in my case) and editing on other platforms by any other text editor, e.g. Emacs. However, some recent features (e.g. the todo list, for which some ten other applications of varying simplicity/feature-richness already exist on F-Droid alone), along with the proposed features in open issues cause concerns over feature creep.

Perhaps a plugin system could be worked out, making for easier maintenance (?) and a customizable user experience? (i.e. users would only install the plugins they want) Older features could be moved into plugins, too, giving users exactly the editor they want - no more, and (unlike super-minimalistic programs) no less."

v0.2.4 from F-Droid

## Steps to replicate
1. Open a (preferably big) file and enter edit mode
2. Move the cursor to any place other than the initial position
3. Switch to another app and switch back

## Expected behavior
Cursor remains where you placed it.

## Actual behavior
Cursor goes back to the initial position.

This happens even when one has opened e.g. the insert image dialog. If you insert the image after switching back, it'll be inserted at the beginning of the file."

<!-- What this is about, what happens and how. What needs to be done for it to happen. -->
First of all. Thanks for this amazing app. Was searching all day for a offline app to take my notes which would support saving notes to files so I could sync them offline (I like to use open source apps so no sync clients for me). Luckly I found this app when I was looking for a markdown app for android :D 
So this issue is mostly because I would like to suggest if its possible to have a feature like Tag so we could find our files faster. Having the search being able to support inside file search would work too.

Thanks.

gsantner/markor,closed,Slow down with code section,[],"If I insert a code section (starting and ending with triple back ticks) in a document and then continues typing in normal text then the text entry quickly slows down, getting several seconds delays after entering a few sentences. If I go back to main file selection view and then in to edit again then it is fine for another 2-3 sentences before slowing down again. I have also tried increasing the highlight delay time from 70 ms to 500ms. That helps but only that it then takes maybe 5-6 sentences of typing before the app slows down. It is still a definite problem. 
I should also say that after the app has become slow it does not help to stop typing for a while. The only thing that I have found helps is going out of the document and back in.

I'm using version 0.2.3.

gsantner/markor,closed,Version controlling of Notebook using Git,"[Label(name=""feature""), Label(name=""wait/maybe/upstream"")]","#### General information
<!-- App version can be e.g. v0.1.1
     System e.g. Android 7.0.1, Nexus 5X -->

* **App version:** v0.2.3
* **System:** v7.0.1

#### Description
It would be great if it would be possible to version control the Markor Notebook folder. For this Git would be a good idea. For the library - maybe take a look at JGit (Gradle: `org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit`), <https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/documentation/>.

 Note that this issue is not fully described, there are many things left open for discussion, e.g. how to deal with merge conflicts. Don't be afraid to ask or bring up your ideas on this.

* Step 1
  * Get a working solution to trigger a manual clone/push/pull via an toolbar option. Public repositories are enough, try it hardcoded for now
  * Just add all files (and new/deleted files), respect gitignore (should work out of the box with library) and commit push
* Step 2
  * Add options to setting to configure Git
  * Username/Password, http Protocol (url)
  * Manual sync using setted setings
* Step 3
  * Auto-Sync - e.g. at startup? time-based? maybe commit when leaving file, push  when wifi?
  * Dealing with merge conflicts? - maybe comparision, do you want to keep this or this?
* Step 4
  * Support for SSH protocol
  * Settings option for location SSH key
  * Settings option for SSH key passphrase

currently it is hard to get the difference between newlines and wrapped lines. The target is to have an toggle in toolbar, which marks every two line in a different color, slightly changes to get the difference.

#### Steps to reproduce
Currently everything is handled as `java.io.File`. `content://` URIs are just converted to File using `getPath()`, which will not work in many cases when data coming from other applications.


#### Expected result
* [x] intent-filter for content URIs for DocumentActivity
* [ ] Content URIs get correctly handled aswell. Includes saving/writing/reading/isFolder/isFile/isReadonly. One has also to check that at content URIs >renaming< may not be possible.

* [ ] Ideally there is the current Document class contains a DocSource Object. Soirce is  a Baseclass, has two derivates, one for file, one for content. Baseclass with an abstract `boolean read/write/move/isFile/isFolder/isReadonly/isMoveable` method. Parameters between activity are shared then with type  `Document` or with the baseclass.
  * Maybe DocumentFile already has required stuff builtin? <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/provider/DocumentFile.html> and openInput/OutputStream on getUri()
* Maybe note future addition of other sources, e.g. Network? A sync provider/library with callbacks? ..

* **Device:**   Samsung Galaxy S8

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Save a textfile with Markdown format and file extension "".md"" in some folder on the phone
2. Open the folder with the Samsung file explorer
3. Tap on the file to open it

#### Expected result
The file should be opened with Markor or a dialogue should be displayed to select a suitable app (if there are multiple options for md files) to select Markor as an option.

**What do you see instead?**
Instead an error message is displayed that the file can't be opened because there is no App for this file type.
The same result if I try to open the file from within the nextcloud app.
I can open the file from within Markor without issues.

gsantner/markor,closed,"Abstract markdown highlighting, allow to switch between highlighters",[],"### General information

* **App version:** v0.2.1

#### Steps to reproduce
Currently the `HighlightingEditor` has everything in it for highlighting markdown. This makes switchting between different highlighting impossible. Currently it's planned to switch between 

* Markdown (current)
* Plain (basically no highlighting) (to be implemented later, seperatly)
* Todo.txt (highlights `@tag`, `+context`)   (to be implemented later, seperatly)

Later there may be then a toolbar-menu-option to switch between these highlighting modes.

#### Expected result
The target is to make highlighting settable, so e.g. a call like `editor.setHightlightingMode(Mode.Markdown)` / `editor.setHightlightingMode(new MarkdownHighlighterMarkdown(params))` possible. Therefore HighlightingEditor itself should not be aware of any Markdown related stuff than anymore, highlighting should be provided by the setted highlighter then.

gsantner/markor,open,Complete rework of filesystem fragment,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","#### General information

* **App version:**  v0.2.1

#### Steps to reproduce
Target is to completly rework the filesystem view/fraent. Currently the app uses adapterkit (Gradle: `com.mobsandgeeks:adapter-kit`) to display the filesystem adapter. This should be replaced by some at least maintained library, or self created.

#### Expected result
The target is to remove the dependecy on the said library and to just use normal layout/adapter/recyvlerview combination with sections.

The said library was last updated 4 years ago and we only use a very small part of it, which is not much lines away from doing it without the library."

* Auto-start the next line for ordered lists with the correct item number
* Pound-sign prefixed headers are always inserted at the start of the line now. Also do this for lists.
* Horizontal rules are only inserted once
* Blockquote auto-populates the next line (like lists) and the shortcut also always inserts the `>` at the start of the line.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create an empty <test> directory

#### What happens

The file count for <test> is 1 when viewed (in Markor) from its parent directory, but when you open <test> the non-markdown files are filtered and it is shown as empty.

#### Expected result

I think the solution is to show non-markdown files in the file list as greyed-out (disabled & non-clickable) entries, because Markor is close enough to a file browser that this is what I naturally expect. Also then you could see the file names of other files (e.g. images) that you might link to in your documents.

Alternatively Markor should just ignore non-markdown files for the directory file count.

Either way the file count and directory contents should be consistent."

gsantner/markor,closed,"Add documentation (markup syntax, features, other projects)","[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""good first issue""), Label(name=""q/discussion/feedback"")]","#### General information

* **Device:** Acer B3-A30
* **Android Version:**  Android 6.0
* **App version:**  v0.1.5

#### Expected result

It would be very helpful to have some kind of Markdown syntax reference in the app, which is quickly accessible from within the edit view. E.g. via a button on the editing toolbar or the application toolbar (next to the preview and share buttons).

This could be simply a flat document, e.g. copied/adapted from [this one](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text), but it should also list any Markdown extension, which are enabled, and link to appropriate documentation (some inspiration might be gleaned from [here](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/)).

Getting back to editing the current document should be possible with one or two taps."
gsantner/markor,closed,FR: add text editing undo/redo,"[Label(name=""feature"")]","#### General information

* **Device:** Acer B3-A30
* **Android Version:**  Android 6.0
* **App version:**  v0.1.5

#### Expected result

- The toolbar has buttons for undo/redo.
- Any edit action is entered into the undo buffer stack (LIFO).
- An edit action is anything that changes the text buffer (regardless of whether it was triggered by the keyboard or a button).
- Single keystrokes could be grouped into a single editing action (time-based?).
- Tapping the undo button, reverts the last editing action and enters it into the redo buffer.
- Tapping the redo button, re-inserts the text removed by the last undo action.
- If another editing action is carried out, the redo buffer is cleared."
gsantner/markor,closed,Markup editing issues,[],"#### General information

* **Device:** Acer B3-A30
* **Android Version:**  Android 6.0
* **App version:**  v0.1.5

#### Steps to reproduce

1. When entering an ordered list, after entering return after the second item line, no new item is generated on the next line.
2. The toolbar button to insert a link does not use the current text selection as the link text.
3. The H1 H2 and H3 buttons should enter the hash sign at the start of the line not at the current cursor position.
4. The button for the horizontal line always inserts two lines of `----`.

#### Expected result

1. If the current line is an (un-)ordered list item and return is pressed, an appropriate item marker should be inserted at the beginning of the next line (after the proper indentation).
2. When something is selected and the link button is clicked, the 'Name' field in the dialog that pops should be pre-filled with the selection text. Nice to have: If nothing is selected but the cursor is currently positioned in a link, the link markup should be parsed and the current link title filled in as well.
3. The hash signs are inserted at the start of the line or the current selection.
4. Only one new line with '----' is inserted."
gsantner/markor,closed,Usability issues,[],"Hi, I tried out Markor on my android tablet and while I find its interface very clean and it promises to be very useful, I've found a few minor issues.

Because theses are mostly minor and so many, I'm writing them all down in this single issue. If you want some of these as extra issues, give me a shout.

#### General information

* **Device:** Acer B3-A30
* **Android Version:**  Android 6.0
* **App version:**  v0.1.5

### Issues

1.  When creating a new document, if only the title has been entered and then the preview icon is tapped, the document is not created and the preview is empty. Even if return has been pressed after entering the title.
2. When the preview is closed with the back arrow the app returns to the list of documents, not to the previously opened document.
3. When entering an ordered list, after entering return after the second item line, no new item is generated on the next line.
4. The file move dialog has no title, so one has to guess what it does.
5. The toolbar button to insert a link does not use the current text selection as the link text.
6. The H1 H2 and H3 buttons should enter the hash sign at the start of the line not at the current cursor position.
7. FR: There is no undo (?)
8. The About page is always in portrait orientation.
9. FR: It would be nice to have a built-in Markdown syntax reference with a list of the supported extensions (if any).
10. The button for the horizontal line always inserts two lines of `----`. Why?"

* **Device: Xperia Z1 compact**
* **Android Version:** 5.1.1
* **App version:** v0.1.2

Sharing text to seadroid is broken because seadroid doesn't seem to know how to handle text content, so I'm not sure if this is a markor  bug that the intent for sharing includes seafile, or if seadroid is registering for the wrong intent. 

Regardless of whose responsibility it is for a graceful failure, sharing markdown from markor as a file with the known markor filename (e.g. name.md) is what I actually want to do. 

#### Feature example

   Given seadroid is installed
   When I share a note from the rendered view
   Then I want an option to send a named file rather than the content of the file for the markdown and html formats
   When I select a file format

gsantner/markor,closed,Complete rewrite of NoteActivity,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""good first issue"")]","* Abstract Note-Data (Title and content) from UI
  * Do not use `edittext/textview.getText()` when saving. Use data objects
  * Use data coming from listener events instead, or other concept
* Ask if something already exists and is to be overridden
  * Only if it would affect an other note (title xx changed to yy, but yy exists)
* Move file if title changed, when saving
  * For this there must be content
  * In force cases (Lifecycle events (e.g. onPause)) try to force save with random name
  * Non-force cases: backpress, preview -> ask here
* Do not save if neither title nor content changed
* Markdown Bar
  * Character based or action based (make it bold = bold icon)?
* Allow editing of external files (via Action.VIEW/SEND intent)
  * Do not allow filename changing in this case
  * Maybe allow importing that file into Markor notebook

Naming:
* Custom title: Use custom title if entered
* Initial title: Keep title if there was already one and nothing was changed there
* When only content is entered: Name = someCharsOfContent + random upcounting number (1,2,3..)
* Use string.trim()

gsantner/markor,closed,enhancement: make links in preview work,[],"#### General information

* **App version:**  v0.1.2

#### Example1   

This md source link `[test](test)` is rendered in preview as html link. 

#### Current result

a click on this linke tries to open ""file:/path/to/test"" with mime type null (no mime)

#### Expected result

a click on this link should open ""file:/path/to/test.md"" with mime type ""text/x-markdown"" if file:/path/to/test.md exist. Else open ""file:/path/to/test.html"" with mime type ""text/html"" if file:/path/to/test.html exist. 

#### Note:

If you install Intent-Intercept (from fdroid store) you can monitor urls with mime type."

gsantner/markor,closed,Fix syntax highlighting #1 ,[],"* Adds plus and hyphen list markers
* Requires a space between list marker and list item text before applying highlighting
* Limits pound-sign header notation to 6 levels
* Require three or more hyphens or equals signs for 'udnerlined' header notation and prevent highlight conflicts with un-ordered lists using hyphens as list markers.

Auto-insert list markers when creating a newline at the end of an existing list item still only works some of the time, however when it does work it also works for plus and hyphen markers."
gsantner/markor,closed,Shortcut bar missing some characters and buttons are too small,[],"#### General information

* **Device:**  Moto G 4G/Zenfone Max
* **Android Version:**  Both Android 7.1 (LineageOS 14.1)
* **App version:** Both v0.1.2

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Make sure 'Show Markdown Shortcuts Bar' is enabled in settings.
2. Open editor

#### Expected result

Access to characters which are buried on the secondary symbols keyboard. Most obvious missing one is \` but  \~ and \+ are also missing.

The buttons also don't expand vertically which makes it frustrating to use them even on a larger device."
gsantner/markor,closed,Better french translation,[],"Thanks to your previous release, I've been able to live test some of my previous fixes. Here is a second batch of translation fix.

I also allowed me to add my name in the Contributor file. Feel free to only cherry-pick the translation fix commit if you don't want my name to appear in the contributor file."

* **Device:** Fairphone 2
* **Android Version:** Fairphone Open 17.09.3 (Android 6.0.1)
* **App version:** v0.1.2

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open Markor and go to preferences
2. Check the preference box, which correspond to the `pref_key__is_editor_statusbar_hidden` ([line 85 of preference file](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/preferences.xml#L85))
3. Go back on any folder
4. Try to open one of your existing markdown file

## Expected result

I have no idea

## What do you see instead?

Markor crashes and I'm redirected to the phone desktop. Unchecking the pref box allow me to open the file again."
gsantner/markor,closed,Duplicated setting in v0.1.2,[],"#### General information

* **Device:**   Fairphone 2
* **Android Version:**  Fairphone Open 17.09.3  (Android 6.0.1)
* **App version:**  v0.1.2

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Open Markor
2. Go to burger menu, settings
3. Look at the different prefs

#### Expected result

Settings should be different

**What do you see instead?**
« Hide status bar » appears twice.

That's because the same labels are used for `pref_key__is_overview_statusbar_hidden` and `pref_key__is_editor_statusbar_hidden` (see lines [32](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/preferences.xml#L32) and [87](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/preferences.xml#L87) of `preferences.xml` file)"

Fix #8 for the case where the renaming is done by changing the title in the editor view.
Tidy up and clarify the `saveNote` method."
gsantner/markor,closed,Inconsistent behaviour & syntax highlighting when creating lists,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""good first issue"")]","#### General information

* **Device:**  Moto G 4G
* **Android Version:**  Android 7.1 (LineageOS 14.1)
* **App version:** v0.1.1

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a note
2. Add a list item (* + - or 1. ) 
3. Press enter at the end of the line

#### Expected result

1. Syntax-highlight the list marker
2. When creating a newline at the end of a list item, the next line should automatically start with the appropriate list marker, preserving indentation.

Syntax highlihghting doesn't work for the + or - markers. For the - marker every second item is highlighted with the header style. Both of those things work as expected in the markdown preview. 

Auto-inserting list markers only works for the * marker, only when editing existing notes, and only after you press enter at the end of a list item that already existed in that note when you loaded it."

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new file, add some text, give it a name
2. Switch to preview
3. Switch back to edit

#### Expected result
The editor shows the information entered in step 1.

Instead the original file is saved but the editor shows a blank file as if you were creating a new one.

For existing notes this works as expected."

So great to finally have a maintained Writeily fork - thanks for doing this.
