If the the app is not open on the receiving side, the OS shows a message: ""New tag collected"" with the note contents in it. But that is not very useful, as it can't be imported into the notes app.

openintents/notepad,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.app.AlertDialog: void setButton(int,java.lang.CharSequence,android.content.DialogInterface.OnClickListener)>:[3,25]
<android.content.Context: android.content.pm.ApplicationInfo getApplicationInfo()>:[4,25]
<android.app.Activity: android.app.ActionBar getActionBar()>:[11,25]
<android.app.ActionBar: void setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(boolean)>:[11,25]
<android.view.MenuItem: void setShowAsAction(int)>:[11,25]
<android.app.ActionBar: void setHomeButtonEnabled(boolean)>:[14,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.
"
openintents/notepad,open,Update WrapActionBar.java,[],"Suppress compilation errors given by Android studio due to several invocations of Android APIs that are not yet existing in API level 9 (the minimum supported SDK version). For example, getActionBar(), setShowAsAction(), setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled() are only interested in API Level 11, setHomeButtonEnabled() is introduced in API level 14."
openintents/notepad,open,"Automatic URL, phone number, etc; automatically opens the link when attempting to open soft keyboard",[],"If you type a phone number, URL, address, in the only line of a notepad file, leave the window, and open the note again, they automatically convert to link format.  Clicking anywhere in attempt to open a soft keyboard or typing return after any of those links opens the link.  This makes it impossible to edit a note with a link as the only text on the only line without a physical keyboard.
"
openintents/notepad,open,Crash when requesting encryption (3),[],"Well, actually not a crash, but a toast saying ""Encryption failed."" and the following in the log. Happens for new notes as well as old ones. I can encrypt a not by closing OiSafe, starting OiNotepad, create a new note and request encryption. It then open OiSafe, I log in and the note is created. I can't update that exact note anymore. Well, can't update any, actually. So create seems to still work, but an update doesn't. Sometime takes me back to OiSafe, sometimes to the notelist. Always with the toast.
I'm on Android 6.0.1 (CM13)

openintents/notepad,closed,Added search feature to notes editor; interworks with global search,[],"I added a feature that allows to search text within a note. Previously, the search function would only show which notes contain a certain text, but not where exactly within a note the search term was found. The new version allows to jump from one occurrence in the text to the next. I found this essential because I have notes that are hundreds of lines long, and searching ""by eye"" was extremely cumbersome.

openintents/notepad,closed,"Store tag filter persistently when App is stopped, e.g. with force stop ...",[],"Fixed a problem in OI Notepad that would cause the currently selected tag filter to get lost when the app was force-closed or the user pressed the back button on the device. The selected tag filter was also lost when the user exited from editing a note by pressing the ""Edit note"" button at the top left of the edit note activity. As a result, OI Notepad did always switch back to the ""All notes"" view. For me this was very annoying because I mostly work in one category of notes and don't want to see others most of the time.

This problem occurred in OI Notepad 1.3 and 1.4.0.7.

The fix stores the active tag filter persistently to survive even when the app is stopped or the device is powered off.

I tried to limit the changes to a minimum. The merge should be straight forward.

openintents/notepad,open,Some pastel love,[],"Hi,

this branch does two things:

*\* First (commits a3a3787, e038c3f, cleaned up in 6b3b5d5,  03a54b6 ) **

Adds color settings to all notes and styles the ActionBar. It includes look&feel, some code & pngs from MIUI notes, which is also Apache licened:

https://github.com/ebraminio/miuinotes

Side Effects: Introduces new DB format (color column).

*\* Second (a047838) *\* 

Wraps the note_editor.xml into a scrollview, which vastly improves scrolling in larger notes.

*\* Rest **

Cleans up broken indenting (courtesy eclipse) and adapts some settings for my froyo device.

Tested: 4.2.2 (JB) and 2.3.? (FR)

TODO:

It ignores the shipped theming system, which I dont care that much ;)
Mention the miui graphics in the EULA
Maybe set the theming only in Code if SDK > 12 (14?)

Comments?

1. create a new note
2. select menu

It seems like that when the screen is rotated, the presence of OI Safe is not checked before running it.
