alaskalinuxuser/app_hourglass,closed,Add continuous notification,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi
I love this open source app and using it quite often. But sometimes my phone is in my pocket and I'm listening to music and I miss the time ended notification ! The vibration is short, easy to miss, same thing for the notifications sounds. I'd find ""logical"" to have a continuous notification that vibrates and rings until I manually stop it (from notification bar or inside app).
Is this feature planned for a future release ? 
Thanks"
alaskalinuxuser/app_hourglass,closed,Show remaining time in notification,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I love this open source app but I only miss a little thing: I'd like to be able to know remaining time without changing my current app when HourGlass is running in background. For this I'd like the notification to showo me remaning time.

Thanks"

alaskalinuxuser/app_hourglass,closed,improve manual time entry,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Thanks for hourglass. I use the manual time entry a lot (I use it to time student group discussions). I believe it could be made much easier to use:
1) when I enter the textfield, the cursor is positioned somewhere. It would be nice to either preselect all minutes or all seconds, depending on where I put the focus.
2) By default, all minutes should be selected, so that I can just start typing the number of minutes I need (and ideally pop up the keyboard automatically as well.
3) When I delete everything and just enter 10, hourglass returns to the main screen, ignoring my entry. It should recognize 10 as 10:00."
