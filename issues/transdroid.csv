A little help with something that has become a real pain here. The problem I'm facing is having Deluge, which is being run behind a Caddy Server reverse proxy, to play nice and operate with Transdroid.

Initially I had issues getting Deluge to even work with Caddy, until I found a solution in this thread: https://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?t=54135.

So the WebUI works with that code input via the reverse proxy; However it won't play nice with Transdroid; it just won't connect. I've followed the Transdroid FAQ by inputting folders and port 443, and also the steps outlined in this thread: https://github.com/erickok/transdroid/issues/302, but no matter what I do Transdroid just won't connect to Deluge through the reverse proxy. Sonarr and Radarr are finding Deluge at the reverse proxy fine though, which shows it can be recognised. 

I'm wondering if it has something to do with the Caddy code as I'm reading people with NGINX and Apache also have to do workarounds with headers and such , yet I can't find a specific Caddy solution.

Here is how my Caddy Deluge config reads:
	
    	rewrite {
    		if_op or
    		if {>Referer} has /deluge
    		if {>Referer} has mydomain.dns.com/themes/css/
    		if {>Referer} has mydomain.dns.com/css/
    		to /deluge/{path}

Whenever I perform a search in Transdroid (2.5.8), it prompts me to install search. But search is installed.
I can remove search from my system (Oneplus 3, OxygenOS 5.0.0, Android 8.0.0, SuperSU rooted), and download it and have it installed by Transdroid when it asks for search to be installed. This will work, until I exit the app. Quite a cumbersome way to make it work. When I load Transdroid after, search is 'gone'.

My server connection is my uTorrent client (3.5.1) running on a Windows 10 machine with web UI enabled on port 8085.

Also interesting (maybe related) when I click on the green add (+) ikon in Transdroid then browse to the Download directory (internal storage), the downloaded .torrent files are there but all of them are grayed, not clickable. Both Chrome and Transdroid has granted access to Storage.

So I used to download with add (+) / url copied, that's works always.

Any idea?

erickok/transdroid,closed,Remove setTitle() call which was causing NPE on orientation change,[],Fixes issue #413
erickok/transdroid,closed,App Crashes on Orientation Change in PreferenceCompatActivity,[],"Repro steps:

Open app
Open Settings
Rotate device.
Crash

Root cause is that PreferenceCompatActivity#onCreate() calls super.onCreate() before creating field acd:

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		acd = AppCompatDelegate.create(this, this);
		acd.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	}

And the base class PreferenceActivity#onCreate() ends up calling setTitle() when triggered from an orientation change. 

	@Override
	public void setTitle(CharSequence title) {
		super.setTitle(title);
		acd.setTitle(title);
	}

This of course results in an NPE.

It's not clear to me if the solution is to protect the acd.setTitle() call with a null check or simply remove the PreferenceCompatActivity#setTitle() entirely. It only seems to be called only when a configuration change is made anyway (and crashes) and the title seems to be set regardless.

This new Adapter does not replace the existing one, it just offers another choice.

The Native RPC API is based on a Secure Socket. Since Transdroid does not maintain an open connection for Adapters, the new Adapter opens a new Socket and logs in (if needed) for each DaemonTask is it executes.

The new adapter depends on a Java Rencode GitHub project [aegnor/rencode-java](https://github.com/aegnor/rencode-java). I could not find a way to add a Gradle dependency so I added the files directly.

The new Adapter shares many constants an a few methods with the old Adapter so a these were refactored into a common class.

erickok/transdroid,closed,rTorrent cannot be connected to Transdroid,[],"Hi

I've searched the web for any guides on how to setup Transdroid with rTorrent and found a couple, But none of them seem to work as intended.

I have rTorrent running at IP_ADRESS:9898 (non https) and at https://IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent. I am using Nginx as webserver and basic HTTP Auth. Nginx redirects port 80 to port 443.

I can connect to IP_ADRESS:9898 with the following settings:
Server Type: rTorrent
IP: IP_ADRESS
User name: UN
Password: PW
Advanced:
- Port Number: 9898
- SCGI mount point: /plugins/httprpc/action.php
When I click the settings button from the main menu it's formatted as such: http://UN@IP_ADRESS:9898/plugins/httprpc/action.php

But I cannot connect to https://IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent with the following settings:
Server Type: rTorrent
IP: IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent
User name: UN
Password: PW
Advanced:
- SCGI mount point: /plugins/httprpc/action.php
- Use SSL: Checked
When I click the settings button from the main menu it's formatted as such: https://UN@IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent:443/plugins/httprpc/action.php.

The problem is that Transdroid adds ':443'.
I can access https://IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent/plugins/httprpc/action.php trough all my browsers (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Opera Next, Firefox), but https://IP_ADRESS/ruTorrent:443/plugins/httprpc/action.php gives me an error ('No input file specified.').

Here's a screenshot. ruLocal is working ruTorrent is not.

How the heck do I remove the ':443'? :)

- missing torrent state for finished (complete && stopped/inactive)
- missing stopped state when stopping/closing torrent without complete
currently have to return state Queued instead
- missing error display: it is passed to the Torrent constructor but Torrent.getError() never called
should we use TorrentState.Error?
- could not test stopall/startall: not used anywhere
don't know if multicall2 can take multiple commands or if we should use 2 calls to multicall2"

erickok/transdroid,closed,"Lint warnings causing display issue, ignored return value of read",[],"Hi,

I am using Lint to check for warnings in transdroid and found the following warnings may cause unexpected results:
1. **Avoid passing null as the view root (needed to resolve layout parameters on the inflated layout's root element)**
This warning is reported [on line 181 in ListWidgetConfigActivity.java](https://github.com/erickok/transdroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/org/transdroid/core/widget/ListWidgetConfigActivity.java#L181) and some other locations. Passing null to the parent parameter will lead to unexpected widget display. This has been a widely discussed problem and I've found some related posts on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5026926/why-does-layoutinflater-ignore-the-layout-width-and-layout-height-layout-paramet/5027921#5027921) and [here](https://possiblemobile.com/2013/05/layout-inflation-as-intended/).

2. **Result of `FileInputStream.read()` is ignored**
This warning is reported [on line 108 in VuzeAdapter.java](https://github.com/erickok/transdroid/blob/877ccd0c3a57830dff0d5a6f11e75e4965c57d32/app/src/main/java/org/transdroid/daemon/Vuze/VuzeAdapter.java#L108).
I think ignoring the return value of read() can be problematic as it may not always read all the contents and fill in the buffer. I found a related post [here](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/FIO10-J.+Ensure+the+array+is+filled+when+using+read()+to+fill+an+array).

In addition I also found many usage of apache http client which has already been deprecated as suggested [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2011/09/androids-http-clients.html). I think this might cause connection problems sometimes.

Hope this information can help you. :)"
erickok/transdroid,closed,Error state when refreshing an RSS feed with no include filter matches?,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Not entirely sure if this is a bug or not, most likely just a minor UI/logic issue or an unhandled result case, but I am using an RSS feed with ~6 include matches (separated by pipe-bars | as instructed), and when the RSS refreshes with zero matches Transdroid returns '-1' on the count for that RSS feed and acts as though the RSS failed to load at all e.g. when you click the RSS feed the error message ""Sorry, please wait until the RSS feed is loaded."" is displayed.

I believe the the display for the RSS should just be zero and no error message displayed on click.

To diagnose this I removed the include matches string I'm using and the RSS loaded no problem with many results, just none that matched any of my include match strings. 

When I first setup this RSS there were two items in the RSS feed that matched my include match strings and the RSS loaded correctly and only showed those two matches.

Totally not a big deal, but I thought I would report it.

The error message only said there was a connection problem.  (I did not capture this.)  I realized my mistake, but before typing a long string, I decided to confirm that my out of date fingerprint was the only problem.  So in Transdroid, under the advanced settings for that server, I checked ""Accept all SSL certificates"", expecting that the connection would complete.

The interface allowed me to check the ""accept all"" option while a custom fingerprint is set, but Transdroid could not complete the connection until I removed the fingerprint.  It seems that if the fingerprint is set, that takes precedence over the ""accept all"" checkbox, and only the fingerprinted cert is accepted.

If that is the case, I would suggest that the ""Accept all SSL certificates"" option be disabled in a visually obvious way when the ""Custom SSL thumbprint"" is set.  The opposite would also be fine:  If ""accept all"" is checked, disable (""gray out"") the ""Custom SSL thumbprint"" field.  That would actually be slightly better for my specific case, since I could toggle on and off strict SSL checking without removing the fingerprint from the settings."

When you click on search the text field should remain empty, but if the user clicks on a search from history, then put that text in the search field and then let them click to search, rather than just searching immediately. This will allow the search text to be editable before searching.

As for settings, I've put in the following:

I'm doing this on an Samsung Galaxy S4 from Verizon.

In my app settings I have it set to Utorrent. The Host name or IP is my computer IP which is housing Utorrent. I have my Username and password setup in both the Utorrent on my computer and in my phone.

But for advanced settings I'm not sure what to do. For port number i have it set to 8080, Local port number is also 8080, for local IP its my computers IP, which is a static IP.

I've followed the steps in the troubleshooting page but I'm not understanding something. It says to put the external IP address into the IP, but where does it go? There's 2 spots one in the normal settings and one in the advanced settings.

Also in the troubleshooting it says to use the IP from WhatismyIp, I thought that I would use the static IP that my computer is using not the external.

I have port forwarded correctly I believe, I had to go into my AT&T router and my Asus router to get them to communicate to each other.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

erickok/transdroid,closed,Different SSL checkboxes for Internal / External network,[],"As already discussed with the developer via email, it would be ideal to have different SSL enablers to internal and external networks, because when a user has a HTTPS reverse proxy to avoid browsing from outside without SSL, it becomes a scenario where the internal network needs to be accessed with common HTTP (even because Transmission doesn't support HTTPS natively), and external using HTTPS (using the secure proxy above).

Today, users like me are forced to:
- Re-configure the server connection every time we change were we are (internal or external)
- Maintain two separate server connections, one internal and other external, which brings two problems:
  a) Totally trashes the entire dual-configuration that is already beautifully implemented in each server connection
  b) As there's no option to ""Open App but don't connect to anything as default"", sometimes you will happen to auto-start the app, receiving a connection error, and ocasionally pushing your plain HTTP credentials to some public IP in the Internet.

Please consider this strongly.

I'm really loving your application, but have recently hit a problem. I'm trying to put all the services of my Ubuntu home server through a reverse proxy, including deluge.

Currently, I can access deluge through a webbrowser using https://mydomain.com/deluge using port 443 (reverse proxied using Apache and using SSL).

But when I try to add the settings in your application (using Transdrone from Play Store at the moment), your application puts the port number in the wrong place.

Namely: https://mydomain.com/deluge:443 instead of https://mydomain.com:443/deluge. If I leave the port number empty, then it will use the default port 8112 instead (also in wrong place).

Is there any way to disable the port number if you are already enabled the SSL option in your application?

Thanks!

I am a huge fan, and using transdroid is easy and works well. However, I recently decided to make my Pi accesible from the internet. I set up stunnel with a self-generated cert, and I was a bit put back. The way to secure transdroid with self-signed certs is tedious, and requires manually entering a SHA-1 fingerprint.

I am a firm believer in sane defaults, and this is not what I would call sane. What most people want when using a self-signed certificate is TOFU (trust on first use). Maybe the default behaviour could be to accept the certificate, and warn on changes (with a checkbox to ignore all errors or to not do any verifications). I would have loved to have a PR ready for you, but I am no programmer.

   Explanation for issues of type ""ValidFragment"":
   From the Fragment documentation:
   Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated
   when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that
   subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these
   constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated;
   instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle)
   and later retrieved by the Fragment with getArguments().

I believe I have traced the problem to the code that sets the XMLRPC size limit in advance of adding the torrent. Because it's not downloading the torrent, but rather a 39-byte error message, it's setting the limit way too low. The result is that Transdroid and rutorrent both lose their ability to communicate with rTorrent.

If I manually adjust the limit back to a more reasonable value, Transdroid and rutorrent resume working without having had to restart rTorrent.

This should be a fairly simple fix--there just needs to be a minimum value (probably a good bit larger than the existing buffer). rutorrent by default automatically sets the limit to 67108863 bytes when it starts running, so I'd guess you have plenty of room.

erickok/transdroid,closed,Can't prevent default launch for .torrent files,[],"With the 2.2 version, Transdroid automatically launches and attempts to load all .torrent files when a browser download starts.  I had a problem when Transdroid intercepted the download, then failed to properly load the torrent file.  I could not find a way to prevent Transdroid from intercepting the download, so I finally had to freeze Transdroid in Titanium Backup to get the file to download to my device.

The ability of Transdroid to default launch on torrent file downloads needs to be controlled by an optional setting.

erickok/transdroid,closed,Unable to add torrents via magnet to Deluge,[],"Recently the ability to add a magnet like to Deluge web UI using transdroid stopped working.  When clicking the link in the browser transdroid opens and reports ""_torrent name_ was added"", but no torrent is added to the list.  Adding a torrent via magnet using chrome or firefox plugins to the same web UI and same deluge daemon still works.

I looked into the deluge logs and when adding via transdroid it reports ""invalid info-hash"".  Checking the JSON requests in the deluge web.log I noticed the following difference between a transdroid request and a request from the Firefox plugin ""BitTorrent WebUI+"":

transdroid: 

{""id"":2,""method"":""core.add_torrent_magnet"",""params"":[""magnet:?xt=urn%3Abtih%3A

FF: 

{""id"":2,""method"":""core.add_torrent_magnet"",""params"":[""magnet:?xt=urn:btih:

It seems that in the JSON requests from transdroid the colons in the xt are being encoded as %3A. 

I wrote a quick fix in the json_api file for my deluge server to de-encode %3A into a colon in the xt portion of the magnet link and adding from transdroid began working again.

Using the same example:  `http://user@www.example.com/torwebui/:1234`

This will not connect to my WebUI client correctly as the port is being placed in the wrong place.

I request that the hostname parser be updated to recognize subdirectories and place the port in the appropriate place in the hostname.

Server Implementation Details

The site that is broadcast by my server is actually all handled by a single web server that reverse proxies the torrent client to a subdirectory of the main site.  In my particular instance this is done by IIS via a URL Rewrite rule and Application Request Routing.  This affords me the ability to only have a single external port open on the internet as an access point, while allowing all my internal apps to talk on the LAN intranet.

Eventually, this Share Link feature disappeared from the web browsers I used (it may have initially been when I switched to Chrome, but the default AOSP browser has since removed it as well. Well, today, I had a few torrents I was going to need to add, so I wanted to be able to long press to do it rather than just copy and paste the links into the app like I normally do (my torrent client doesn't accept magnet links through the web interface, so you can't use transdroid to load magnet links). So I went and downloaded firefox, which does still have the share link option. However, only Transdroid Search comes up in the list of providers, and selecting that opens up Transdroid but then opens up a browser selection dialog. Selecting a browser will just download the torrent, which then requires you to click on it to load it in the program.

erickok/transdroid,closed,RSS Feed Improvement,[],"Hi there. 
First of all let me thank you for this great project you have here. 
I am using transdroid with Transmission and I find it really useful for managing my torrent downloads. I have a few RSS feeds to see the latest releases of movies but it lacks a very important feature which is a fast way to retrieve the rating and the plot for the movie (this could also be useful for series). 
Currently there is the ability to ""Open website"" from the context menu after you long-click the feed entry but sometimes this websites don´t have any useful content about the movie, like the plot and rating and you are forced to use your browser and make a Google search for the movie to find what it is about, than decide if you want to download it and get back to transdroid and add the entry to your torrent client. 
This is a very tedious task for a movie junkie that checks every new release out there.

My suggestion would be to integrate transdroid with some external information providers like IMDB, The Movie Database and The TV Database websites to fetch information about the torrent and present it in a user friendly layout inside transdroid without much effort from the user. It could be a new option on the context menu like ""Show Movie information"" or ""Show Series Information"".

Of course not every torrent is a movie or a tv show and that new option should only be available according to the type of content selected. It would be good to have a new setting defined in every RSS feed that would indicate which type of content would be delivered. I believe most people have separate feeds for each content type so this would be a nice approach to the problem.

You guys probably gonna call me lazy and I am, but I also think transdroid was created for lazy people who have the need to manage their torrent queue from anywhere. 

I think integration with The Movie Database and The TV Database would be fairly straightforward since they provide REST API´s and there would be no need for scraping any HTML content.

erickok/transdroid,closed,Is the download directory setting disabled in Transmission and Deluge?,[],"Hello, 

After reading issue #49 I understand Transmission and Deluge types allow to set a download directory in Transdroid. Also, in ChangeLog, I'm reading that there was a fix for Transmission Download Directory setting. However, I still am not able to set a download directory in ""Optional Parameters"" in Transdroid (the button is ""disabled"") when I'm adding a Transmission server (same thing for Deluge).  

Is it a bug, or is it normal?
Also, is this setting planned for rTorrent server type (issue #49 was already asking this, but there was no real answer to this question)?

erickok/transdroid,closed,"Feature request: Multiple selection ""Remove Torrent"" and ""Remove and delete data""",[],"Absolutely love your app. I've just been missing one feature..

To be able to remove multiple torrents at once. You can already remove single torrent by ""Clicking torrent > X Icon > ""Remove Torrent"" or ""Remove and delete data"".""

I'd wish for that being possible from the main GUI. 

""Hold finger on a torrent until you're able to select multiple > Click on bottom right side where the ""Set label"" popups > Then choose options ""Remove Torrents"" or ""Remove and delete data""

So it's basically just to add two new labels, do a for() { } loop of selected torrents doing the removing/deleting.

Thanks in advance :)

I do not know the point of that when its seeds that really need to be shown the most.

Because with no seeds available that means no-one has the full file and can NEVER finish downloading.

Here is a screenshot shoeing this bug, I have underlined in red the issue so you can clearly see what I mean.

I reported it ages ago (over a year go I think) but nothing ever got fixed.  Transdroid really needs to clearly show both seeds/peers because I have downloaded and even these files downloading now have dropped down to 0 seeds and I cannot rely on Transdroid to show me that torrents that are not be fully able to be downloaded as its stopping me from using transdroid as a full remote replacement to the client.

And what happens when I'm not downloading of any peer but only from seeds, its shown as '0 OF X PEERS' of course.

erickok/transdroid,closed,Cannot set a zero length port number (my url does not have a port at the end),[],"What steps will reproduce the problem?
My usage is 

http://myname.no-ip.something:13456/deluge

I need to set the port field to mull, so it would work.

When I set to null, the app crashes when showing the first screen

What version of the product are you using?
2 alpha4

What torrent client are you using?
Deluge 1.3.6

I put nothing in the port thinking, it would help me create my url as needed, and then it crashes when I try to get to the main screen

```
Anti-Feature: Tracking. It will connect to transdroid.org as soon as you run it, and periodically after that. Information exposed is probably limited to your IP address, OS version and Transdroid version.
```

Could you please put the tracking anti-feature in opt-in ?

Thanks in advance,
