A workaround is to set openscale unit to kg when syncing data, and when you need to look at charts for actual values, manually toggle over to lbs. This thens converts the kg units to lb correctly, but only for old data.

The issue appears that openscale does not support automatic conversion of units from scale (kg) that is different from the user preference (lb).

I've noticed that after a scale sleeps, the app fails to pick up the scale again when it wakes back up. Instead, the user has to manually tap on the Bluetooth icon in the app twice (to turn it off and to turn it back on) to find the scale. Is this normal behaviour or is it a bug? Does the app not automatically search for a new scale on the background after losing the previous connection?

Thanks"

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Problems with Sanitas SBF70 ,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello,
Many thanks for developing openscale. This development was the reason for my buyig the SBF70. At the time of my purchase I did not notice the issues with the SBF 70 - I was happy that is labelled as supported.

Since issue [252](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/issues/252) was closed I am starting here a new issue. I hope this is fine.

I am experiencing problems with the Sanitas SBF70. I am using Android 7.0 Kernel 3.18.31

After going throrugh the different issues in this depository, I started with version 1.7.1 - hoping this would work with the SBF70. 
I could select the scale in the bluetooth settings - and weight readings were retrieved from the scale. No user was created in the balance. No further data were downloaded from the balance.  I stepped on the scale three time with an interval of 1 minute in between.

Then I registered a user with the healthcoach app (after uninstalling openscale)
weight and further reading were  read out from the balance.

I could not obtain any reading with openscale 1.7.1.

Then I changed to the dev version dated 2018-08-20 19:26:52 UTC (obtained from https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/releases). I could choose the sbf 70 from the bluetooth settings. , When try to retrieve any data, I could not get any readings either. Resetting the balanced did not help. 
When trying to retrieve data I did obtain in German something like ""connection established"", and than something like ""connection lost""
I tried in the dev version to create a bt log (https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-G5-Moto-G5-Plus/Bluetooth-BLE-problem-on-moto-G5/m-p/3961770/highlight/true#M18512) and subsequently an error log of openscale.

Can this be fixed?

pretty much has everything you need! I haven't tested any of the user storage functionality (it's way past bed time and sending commands with _nRF Connect_ is very manual, usually resulting in the scales turning off before I can send) but everything in there seems to work with regards to measurements.

Can confirm my device service is `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

Can confirm notifications from `0000fff1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` of 8 bytes

**Standard operation**
`FF A5 02 03 04 05 06 07`

`FF` is discarded
`A5` is measurement
`06` Is type

If `06` is `AA` or `A0` then the measurement is weight in KG and lb, `AA` means stable measurement, `A0` unstable measurement.
`02 03` is weight in  100 gram increments (611 is 61.1kg)
`04 05` is weight in lb

**After triggering a fat test**

If `06` is `B0` then the measurement is Fat and Hydration, if it's BE then there was an error

`02 03` is fat in 0.1% increments (218 is 21.8%)
`04 05` is hydration in 0.1% increments (53.5 is 53.5%)

If `06` is `C0` then the measurement is Muscle and Bone

`02 03` is muscle in 0.1% increments (543 is 54.3%)
`05 04` is bone in 0.1% increments (39 is 3.9%) - *nb this is backwards*

If `06` is `D0` then the measurement is calculated calories

`02 03` app lists as amr kcal

If `06` is `E0`, `E1`, `E2`, or `F0` then its related to stored data sets

Is possible add support to Yunmai Balance?  "
oliexdev/openScale,closed,Add a ContentProvider so other apps can access (with permission) the …,[],"…openScale data.

This could be used for e.g. syncing weight logs to a third-party service such as Google Fit,
without the openScale app having to do so; with this, a 'connector' app could be written that
reads this data and does the push to a third-party service (or, indeed, an HTTP RPC connector,
an MQTT connector, SMS notifications, or anything else) without openScale needing this
functionality (or additional permissions).

This is a straw-man implementation; happy to discuss how you think this should work, if this is a dumb idea altogether and I should abandon it, etc. Really a proof-of-concept as much as anything else. This is, though, basically the approach suggested by oliexdev at https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/issues/82 - ""Another solution is to write for e.g. lets call it ""openScale Connector"" app which listen and access the internal sql database of openScale and send any new data via MQTT or to any company clouds (GARMIN,Google Fit and so on)"", and I think a ContentProvider is the most ""Androidy"" way to do this (and allows locking down this sensitive data behind permissions to prevent malicious apps doing so without user knowledge).

Here's how the flow looks from a dummy third-party app I hacked together which just dumps the data as text:

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Incorrect display/calculation of goal weight and weight difference in statistics screen v1.8.1,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","In version 1.8.x (1.8 and 1.8.1), the goal weight and weight difference are not displayed correctly in the Statistics tab. The first problem is that when using the Imperial system units (lbs, in), regardless of what is entered for user's starting weight and goal weight, the goal weight does not match what is entered in the user profile. This happens regardless of other user profile information (gender, height, etc.). See example below:

Data from user profile:
Initial weight: 200.0 lb
Goal weight: 175.0 lb

Data displayed in statistics tab (no additional measurements)
Goal weight: 79.4 lb
Weight difference: 79.4 lb

Data displayed in statistics tab (measurement at 198 lb added)
Goal weight: 79.4 lb
Weight difference: 118.6 lb

It correctly calculates goal weight but does so with the incorrect goal weight. After putting in a couple different values for goal weights, it looks like what may be happening is that the values may be getting converted to SI units (kg) while still retaining the English label (lbs), i.e. 175.0 lb = 79.4 kg.

The second (minor) issue is that regardless of which unit system is used, the weight difference is not correctly calculated when there are not any measurements entered, i.e. immediately after the user is created but before the first set of measurements is entered. In other words, the app currently displays **weight difference = goal weight** (see above), but instead it should be calculated it as **weight difference = initial weight (from user profile) - goal weight**. Then when a users has entered their first weight value in the app, the formula would change to **weight difference = most recent measured weight - goal weight**.

Also, as an aside, thank you for all the work you are doing on this app - it is a great resource and a very helpful contribution to the open source ecosystem on Android! :) keep up the great work!"

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Feature request: Data points for absolute body fat,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Hi, first off thanks for your efforts - i am not using closed source apps and i'm super happy this exists.

What would greatly improve my experience is a possibility to show absolute fat and fat-free mass w.r.t. the weight and body fat percentage measurements - not estimated values but just do (weight*percentage/100) and (weight - abs. fat).
So one would obtain this in the graph view:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26491995/39442671-5cdb6c90-4cb2-11e8-91ca-5c869fb3ee3e.png)

For me, these four metrics are the important ones because they show me how my body develops - in the example above i could see at first glance that i may be losing weight, but gaining muscle.


Also cool would be if i could enter the caliper measurements directly in the app and make it calculate the body fat percentage automatically. Right now i have to do it by hand or go on some website. I guess that would mean one more measurement to be enabled via toggle (plus a selection which calculation method should be used) and hard code the formulas (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipometrie#Berechnungsmethoden).
I realize though that i might be the only who would use this, and the current way is fine too.

Thank you

is supposed to tell me!""."

* Remove initial weight. It's confusing to have to enter it when you want to connect to a scale to get the weight.
* Ask the user if he/she wants to connect a Bluetooth scale after adding the user.
* Change ""device type"" in Bluetooth settings to something that indicates that it starts a device search.

But if I add other measurements (e.g. body fat) to the graph, they became flat lines.
And that is no fun.

It is because the Y axis has to spread across all the data points. And weight and body fat are in different data range.
I suggest the graph support a secondary Y axis, So that, the primary and secondary Y axis can have different data range.
User can have option to choose which measurement data reference to which Y axis.

It would be really nice to have some kind of post processing of the measured data with support of sending the data via curl or something to my server. This would be a very generic solution so there are a lot of different cases to use this functionality.

Perhaps you could add some text boxes: one to set the servers url and some more boxes to add the links parameters. 

Idea of sending JSON: https://gist.github.com/subfuzion/08c5d85437d5d4f00e58

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Complete Pain to pair with scales,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Here's the ritual I had to perform to connect with scales (may be manufacturer problem).

1. Open settings, turn on Bluetooth, turn on discoverability, rename device
2. Restart phone
3. Open app, goto settings, bluetooth.
4. Power on device, and whilst standing on scales, click device to search for what looks like a mac address.
5. Step off of scales, go back to home screen in app, and click pair
6. Step on the scales, if it doesn't work, repeat stepping on and off and clicking pair, only after a toast message appears

It's a fantastic app and has saved me from having to send my data to the scale manufacturer app of choice (seemed to include telemetry, a user account requiring online access etc). 

Anything that can be done to improve scanning for Bluetooth devices would be awesome.

Allowing my phone to disconnect from the scales would likewise be great as right now I cannot use bluetooth headphones if my wife wants to weigh herself.

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Sanitas SBF 70 stops working (absolutely no measurements),"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi all,

first of all, thanks to all developers of openScale! It's great to see that you are ""freeing"" these devices!

I have some major connection issues with this scale. I had it working twice (and I'm familiar with the setup procedure), but after some time the scale stops to send any values to the smartphone (not even weight). Both devices are connected, and the bluetooth symbol in the LCD turns on and off as expected.

Resetting the scale does not work. This afternoon I had my ""second"" success after connecting the scale to another Android device (a Windows tablet which booted Android-x86 CM 14.1-r1) - I think this helped, but as I said, the problem returned.

I have the feeling that this could be due to other bluetooth devices interfering. Maybe openScale tries to connect to another device in my (really big) apartment building, or the firmware in the scale gets confused by this environment.

I'm using the FDroid build (1.7.1) on a Android 7.0 phone (Wilefox Spark).

I would love to further investigate this - how can I access the app's logs?

Keep up the good work!
Best, Sebastian"
oliexdev/openScale,closed, Updated translation,[],Added missing strings with their translations. Some minor corrections.
oliexdev/openScale,closed,New SBF-75 instability on measurements,"[Label(name=""question"")]","## Issue
- SBF-75 does show user name in scale (--- instead) anymore.
- Also, history is not stored anymore. The scale needs to be actively connected to the app while measuring or the measurement will be lost.
- If two users with similar weight ranges are present, measurements might be wrongly associated to a user.
- Registering a profile with a name with the same prefix on two devices appears to cause havoc on the scale.

## Observed behaviour leading to the issue:
- I've tested #205 on a different device (Also Android 7.1.2) using the dev-build given then. For that purpose I've created and connected the app to the scale, that time using a username with a similar 4 letter prefix.
- Measurement as illustrated worked fine on both scales.
- I guess starting with the upgrade 1.7.1 the issues illustrated above appeared. This time on both devices. Maybe the scale has issues handling multiple devices, or the user creation process has issues? Any ideas how to debug this?
  - I've tried to fully reset the scale, however this appeared to have no effect.
  - I've tried to create a new, different, non-prefix similar user and have it registered, and shown on measurements, however to no avail.
- This might also include issues with non-weight-only measurements.

I'd be happy to get any insight or ideas on how to debug this, as the state before this was very nice and stable.  "

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Carry over additional measurements not present in all records,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","# Use Case:
As a user I would like to be able to realize the following use case:
- Daily use of one of the supported BTLE scales using them to measure whatever they provide. (Schedule A)
- Weekly or less than daily measurement of other manual metrics such as e.g. waist size (Schedule B) 
- I would like to have the current measurement of schedule B to be carried over / applied to measurements of Schedule A until the next measurement of schedule B is available.
- Thus, all records would have data for automatic and manual measurements present. 

# Rationale / Current state
- Currently I have to generate a new measurement that gets the latest automatic / schedule A measurements and add my manual measurements.
- Upon looking at the diagrams this leads to wrong / weird display of data as it appears that the 0 entries for the additional / manual measurements on schedule A records are included in the diagramming / calculation process leading to wrong / undesirable results."

first of all: thanks for the great work of reverse engineering the SBF 70!

I have trouble with getting body fat readings. I read the FAQ, tried resetting the scale - it did not work. My hypothesis is that the initialization is not working properly. I am using v1.7 (23) installed via F-Droid.

Workaround: When I used the Sanitas HealthCoach app to initialize the scale and add the user, I received body fat readings.

Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that the user initialization is not working properly, but that is only a vague assumption based on the workaround and a quick glance at the log files. [sbf70log.txt](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/files/1708524/sbf70log.txt)

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Suggestions for small improvements,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","After a week of using the app, a couple of suggestions:
 - exporting the table: currently the export file is  `/openScale_data_user.csv`. But I want to export the table to a different folder, e.g. one that I sync to the cloud. So, every time I have to manually add the folder name or to use a file manager to move the file from '/'. It would be more user friendly if the last user input (e.g. folder and filename) were  kept.
 - with my ageing eyes the blue, green and red limits for the parameters (weight, BMI etc) in the overview page are with such a tiny font that I cannot really tell those numbers. Is it possible to increase the font a little bit?

oliexdev/openScale,closed,hardware choice is hard,"[Label(name=""question"")]","I can choose freely, great.  But capitalism also sucks - there are so many crappy products out there.  

just want   

* a good scale, which is 
* sufficiently accurate, and which 
* has a good app.

When checking all scales apps, I was *really* happy to find your App ""openScale"". Great that you go through the effort of freeing that type of hardware, much much appreciated.  Also I assume many of the other apps force us to store stuff in the cloud, and I don't want that.

Some app ratings:  

4.2 openScale  
2.8 Medisana VitaDock+  
2.7 renpho  
2.6 Yolanda (marsboy, AnGeer)
2.5 New iwellness (hamswan?)
2.4 1byone wellness 2.0  
which other apps are out there?

## choose hardware 

Now ... as I have not yet bought the scale ... **which one do you recommend**?

At the moment your wiki (is it uptodat?) looks as if everything is pointing to the [Medisana BS444](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/wiki/Supported-scales-in-openScale); because you have a dedicated page for that one (and the only other one, Xiaomi, is not yet fully freed); and the Medisana has no warnings in the table (apart from n/a not applicable -  *why* is that not appilicable here?).

The Medisana gets 3.3 out of 5.0 points from 383 customers ([DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01DPJSOT6/), none in [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DPJSOT6)), and [21% disappointed](https://www.amazon.de/product-reviews/B01DPJSOT6/ref=cm_cr_dp_hist_one?filterByStar=one_star) people talk about the drawbacks.

I don't want to **buy** on Amazon - but the ratings (are sometimes manipulated yes, but) help to avoid totally crappy products - and after choosing, then I can buy locally, not from the devil. 

Some (rather randomly selected) scales:

* Marsboy - not many [disappointed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01N99NODP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - ""Amazon's choice""
* AnGeer - very few [disappointed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B06W54P7M7/ref=acr_dpx_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - (actually 87% happy could mean manipulated?)
* Hamswan - [still very few opinions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B074CGC4LJ), unclear which app to use - ""Amazon's choice""
* 1byone - [many many reviews](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B01FHF9DOQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) - ""Amazon's choice""
* Omron [BF508](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0033AGBVG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) and [BF511](https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B0033AGBVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_hist_1?filterByStar=one_star) do not mention Bluetooth? 

That handle for the hands ... looks like it makes a lot of sense to measure visceral fat.

**Important:** But if the scale is not supported by your app, I don't want it.


Here are lists of popular scales:

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Sanitas SBF 70 related questions,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi, a few questions please:

I've just started to use openScale to get my measurement data from my Sanitas SB70 (I had been using Sanitas HealthCoach app quite successfully (surprising I know!) for a number of months, but recently it stopped communicating; might be related to the Fitbit app recently installed?).

So I've got openScale talking to the scales ok, but it operates slightly differently from HealthCoach. I've tried looking through all the FAQs etc for info, but couldn't find anything that helped.

• It hasn't downloaded the history of measurements that were left in the scale since the last successful sync with HealthCoach, is that correct/expected behaviour?
• The data sync only seems to work at the time I weigh myself; if I try the data sync some time after, it doesn't load the most recent measurement, is that expected?
• I've exported all my data from HealthCoach to Excel. Looking at various comments, it would seem I need to use the latest dev/beta build to be able to successfully import those, is that correct? If so, will that delete the most recent measurements in openScale or do I need to export those first, combine with the HealthCoach data and import it all back in?

Despite the questions, just want to say thanks for developing this app, it looks good and means I don't have to throw away the scales! (Once I've used and got know it a bit more I'll stick a rating on Play store)."

oliexdev/openScale,closed,SBF75 - Not properly switching users?,"[Label(name=""question"")]","I'm currently on the dev version as that's the only version currently that works with the SBF75, and it works like a charm for a single user. But with multiple users it's having some difficulties. Regardless on what 'profile' I set the app to, according to the SBF75 it keeps showing the first added user, rather than my own.

So For example, I have 2 users called Demo 1 and Demo 2.

Sometimes its saving the data on the proper account (Demo 2 on the app, Demo 1 on the device, but writes the data to Demo 2 on the app). 

And sometimes using Demo 2 on the app, showing Demo 1 on the device but writes the data to Demo 1 on the app instead.

The SBF75 also starts with no name, as such i have to stand on it to get a clue which name it is choosing. Not sure if this is related to the device itself, or the name is not being transferred correctly from the app to the device to show the proper name.

Any clue to why this is happening?"

I want to import measurements from a file but I could not find any documentation on what the CSV columns should be. I exported my current measurements from `openScale` and it is easy to guess some of the columns, but not all of them.

The easiest way to improve this would be to add the column names when exporting the `openScale` measurements to a CSV file. And of course, better use human understandable column names :-)

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Refactor measurement views,[],"The biggest part of this PR involves refactoring the inheritance hierarchy for MeasurementViews by adding a new FloatMeasurementView that all measurement views that holds a float inherits from. This way the base class MeasurementView can be cleaned up as much code is moved to FloatMeasurementView where it can deal with the value in a more explicit way as it is always float there.

The second part of this involves changing the DataEntryActivity to not save measurements to the database when navigating between them unless they have been modified. This improves the performance when switching between measurements. I have some more things I would like to do in this area, such as changing how the active user is handled, but that is for later.

DataEntryActivity now holds on to a clone of the ScaleMeasurement it is displaying, which makes it easier to update when something changes and cascade the changes to the other views.

Other performance improvements includes not updating the views unless the value has changed and using SpannableStringBuilder instead of Html.fromHtml to style text (only in MeasurementView, not yet in TableFragment)."

For BMI one uses age and sex instead of the simplified version which considers normal everything between 18.5 and 24.99.
For weight, however, one just assumes that normal BMI is between 20 and 25 (for men) and from it and the heigth it derives the normal weight.  For ages>40 or ages<20 this leads to inconsistencies (one could be overweight according to weight and underweight according to BMI). The assumed variation of ""normal"" BMI with age is probably  too agressive. Probably one should set the correct BMI limits first and from them derive the correct weight limits.

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Reverse engineering Yunmai mini scale,"[Label(name=""help wanted""), Label(name=""scale support"")]","I am trying to reverse engineer the yunmai mini scale.

I already found out the weight values but I can't figure out the body fat percentage, muscle percentage and so on. Any help or idea is welcome.

So far what I got:

- No weight values are stored on the scale itself. You have to be connected to the yunmai app to receive any data
- Weights are continuous send to UUID: Unknown (0xffe4) (if you stay on the scale)
- Sent values are like `0d:1f:0b:01:59:c6:15:2f:26:95:03`
  * byte 0-6: bytes are constant
  * byte 7: first nibble is constant, second nibble is changing
  * byte 8-9: contains the weight value (here `0x2695` = 9877 = 98,77 btw the value is rounded in the yunmai app as 98,8 kg)
  * byte 10: is changing
- last measurement from the scale of the continuous sent send data looks like `0d:1f:14:02:00:59:c6:15:2f:23:d0:b6:32:26:95:00:a5:08:f2:37`
  * byte 0-5: bytes are constant
  * byte 6: first nibble is constant, second nibble is changing
  * byte 7-8: bytes are changing
  * byte 9-12: bytes are constant
  * byte 13-14: contains the weight value again
  * byte 15: bytes are constant
  * byte 16-19: bytes are changing
- after that the yunmai app send some values to the scale. In response they send some values back to the scale like the following `0d:1f:12:06:01:23:d0:b6:32:af:01:19:55:5a:8d:26:01:6f`
-  I guess that the values displayed in the yunmai app are rounded values like as the weight value
- Since so many bytes are constant and only few bytes are changing it could be possible that the information of the body measurements (like fat, muscle, water percentage etc.) are compressed or somehow encrypted. (for example a fat percentage of 22,9 % is somehow in the above values encoded)

Here are my Bluetooth log files with the corresponding body measurements which we have to find (open it with wireshark):

**23.9.2017 07:36**
[btsnoop_hci_979.log](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/files/1326417/btsnoop_hci_979.log)
* Weight 97,9 kg
* Body fat 22,9 %
* Muscle 51,7 % 
* Water 56,0 %

So please add options to use average values for one day (in month view diagram) and average values for one month (in year view diagram).

I would also like to have an option to set the diagram on the overview page to 'average per day' values. This would lead to one point per day. The default (one point per measurement) is absolutely ok and correct but if you often step on the scale more than once per day (for testing or for another reason) this diagram loses its usefulness.

I would expect that the list is ordered from old (top) to new (bottom). I think the main reason for creating two or more users is the smart assignment filter function. And the first created user is probably the most (or even the only) important one since it is created when you start openScale for the first time. Being able to manually move the users up and down would be nice too."
oliexdev/openScale,closed,MiScale initial sync: Better way to assign values to users?,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""question"")]","While testing version 1.5.2 I stumbled upon an annoying problem:

If you use your scale with more than one person you have to set additional openScale user(s) to use the smart assignment for filtering away unwanted measurements.

But when you initially sync your MiScale, ALL stored values are synced to the currently active openScale user and you have to manually delete A LOT OF measurements after that. I tried it with two users but I don't know what do do if there are more family members using the scale.

Is there another (less time-consuming) way to assign the values to the users? Our scale is almost two months in use and I had to delete virtually hundreds of values. What happens if one installs openscale and there are thousands of values stored on the family scale? ... 
There must be a better way to achieve this separation... (multiple cut paste for example, or selecting and moving all values in a specified weight range).

The current behavior works but it can be extremely exhausting for new openScale users to sync their scale if their family used the MiScale for months/years before.

I think MiFit simply ignores all old values when you register a new user and asks you to step on the scale to 'connect' your user to the right weight range. In fact the users of MiFit even don't know that their scale provides a history of old values. I think most of them would be satisfied if openScale behaves like MiFit in this point - at least as the default.

edit
Idea: When a user tries to sync his MiScale to an 'empty openScale user"", openScale could ask him to step on the scale and after that press ok. Then openScale could do the sync and discard all but the last value. In future syncs only fitting measurements younger than the initial sync could be added to this openScale user. This would mimic the MiFit behavior."

oliexdev/openScale,closed,MiScale and two phones: syncing 'deletes' measurements,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello oliexdev,

currently I'm on openScale 1.5.2 (via F-Droid) and have the following problems.
My wife and me have two phones. On every phone we have two openScale users to use the smart assignment function of openScale.

In the morning we both stepped on our MiScale (me at 6:15 am, my wife at 6:45am). After breakfast (~ 7:30 am) we tried to sync our phones to get the new values. But unfortunately only my wife got the two new values. It seems like only the first phone that syncs gets all the measurements and after that they are gone. To check this behavior I stepped on the scale again and after that my own phone was able to receive this fresh measurement. But when I synced with my wifes phone after that, there were no new measurements again.

I also tried to remove the batteries of the Scale. Then I synced the Scale with my wifes phone and got a lot of very old measurements (as expected). But when I synced with my own phone after that, there were no measurements again. I had no more time to check but I bet that if I reset the batteries again and then do the initial sync with my phone, my phone will get all the old values.

I checked both users on both phones. At this time both phones have a complete disjunct set of measurements.
This behavior is not very practical for using the scale with more than one person - as most families do.

I think this could be an side effect of the fixed time bug. Would you please try to find a better multi user solution?

Thanks for your time!

oliexdev/openScale,closed,wrong dates and times (Mi Scale firmware v0.5.8),"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello oliexdev,

first I want to thank you for this great app. Me and my wife also don't like to push our personal data to the cloud. When I found your app, I decided to order a Mi Scale for us.

But now we have headaches with the dates of the measurements. Me and my wife use two phones with openScale (1.5) to track our weight. On both phones we first created two accounts in openScale. Then we did some test measurements and synced our phones to the scale. We had to delete some of the first values on each phone because they went to the wrong user, but despite of that everything went fine.

But when we used the scale again two days later, all new synced values got dates and times of our test measurements, or maybe the date of an deleted test measurement. So we took out the batteries of the scale and reinstalled openScale and took some test measurements but the next day the same thing happened. All new measurements get the date and of one of the test measurements. Deleting some or all measurements in openScale also didn't help.

I mentioned the fw version because I think that this could be the root of our problems. When we got the scale, I first connected it to Mi Fit and after a break of a minute or two Mi Fit displayed the firmware of the scale as ""v0.5.8"". Mi Fit didn't mention any update process but perhaps it had silently updated the scales firmware. I think so, because when you connect a Mi Band it gets updated as well. And new fw versions often lead to problems with Gadgetbridge, an open source app for mi band sync (see https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Mi-Band-Firmware-Information).

Could anyone please try to sync his Scale to Mi Fit and report back, what firmware version is displayed? And then check again, if syncing to openScale shows the right dates for new measurements. Perhaps Xiaomi changed the transmission protocol ...

And another question:
- How many measurements are stored in the scale and transmitted as history when you sync? And are the transmitted measurements deleted after that? (the openScale wiki is not clear about that) I ask because we want to use our two phones alternating and don't want to miss weights on each of them. And we don't want to take the ""live"" weight holding our phones in the bathroom. Instead we would like to use the history to sync our measurements every day or two. Is this possible?

Could you please consider adding a section at the Wiki page for each hardware device to clearly outline how well it is supported by the app? The app page says Xiaomi is supported, but is it really fully supported? I would like to make sure before buying one.

Also, I would be happy to buy through your Amazon affiliate link, or something similar, if you have one. If you do not have one, it might be worth setting up. I think I am not the only person who would like to give back for your work.

oliexdev/openScale,closed,App sometimes crashes when trying to connect to Mi Scale,"[Label(name=""question"")]","Hi oliexdex,

its great to see someone creates open source apps that save your privacy for products that want to share everything with the cloud. Thank you.

I bought the Mi Scale, downloaded your app Open Scale (v1.4.3) from F-Droid with a LG G4 with Cyanogenmod 13 (Android 6.0.1) and tried to connect it to the scale. I also deactived the privacy features for this app. Only the firewall (Afwall) is activated.

Often it works and I can receive the values from the scale. But more often the app crashes. Sometimes immediately after the start and sometimes after I tap on the bluetooth Symbol within the app.

Then it works for quite a few times and after a while it is broken again --> crash after trying to connect.

Maybe there is a problem if I start the app when I am standing on the scale already and the scale is still changing the weight quickly.

I can not locate the problem in detail but maybe you experienced similar things. 

How does the app handle BLE-information that it does not understand? Does it ignore it or might this be the reason for the crash? Maybe you could catch errors within the app?

Best regards

oliexdev/openScale,closed,Inappropriate scale for charts,"[Label(name=""question"")]","First of all, thanks for the app!

I'd like to mention that the scale you use while building charts (starting from 0) isn't the best solution. This results in almost straight line, especially on small screen of a smartphone. This makes the chart completely useless. No one will weight 0 or 10 or 20 (even 60 for me personally) kilos. And there's no need to use this values while building charts. The better way is to take upper and lower results, add some margin (say, 2-5 kg) and use the resulting scale. Or use target weight as lower bound.

Also, in a year chart there's no need to reserve the scale up to end of the year. Doing so in January we will get almost blank screen. X-line should have 1st of January as 0 and the current date (plus some margin, say, one week) as its right bound.

And the last, putting all the values on a chart isn't a good idea when you have many records. Better not to put at all (or have a setting to put or not) or put only for peak values.

Look what I have in openScale and other similar program with exactly the same data:
