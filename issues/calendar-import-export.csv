SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export,open,Newly generated UIDs on export are made persistent,[],"I am using calendar-import-export to have a purely local calendar solution over MTP only, with 3-way-merge of diverging calendars on my desktop and on my smartphone.

An issue in Android is that newly created calendar entries carry no UID for ical by default (I am using Etar on top of Offline Calendar). As I found it, calendar-import-export creates those ad-hoc: they are in the exported ical but with no backlink to the local calendar, which means that you can never re-import those in a valid way since they will always emerge as duplicates.

One solution is in this pull request: if UIDs have to be created, store them in the originating calendar entries.

The pull request is intended as a base for discussion and surely can be improved. One e. g. could argue that changing entries by just exporting them is not what a user expects; hence you could think about a setting which allows you to turn on and off that behaviour. Or to choose between not exporting entries with no UID at all or adding them on-the-fly.

I am  looking forward to your feedback."

I am trying to script the adb push of my ics file to Android device and then trigger from Linux Bash script / ADB the upload of the ICS file to Android calendar .

SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export,open,"Version 2.6 on Android 2.3.6: ""No calendars found.""",[],"I just installed this app from F-Droid, version 2.6, onto a **Motorola XT320** running **Android 2.3.6 / Gingerbread**. The phone contains **one local calendar**, operated by what appears to be Android's **stock calendar app** of that era. My objective is to extract the (significant amount of) data from this calendar onto a computer. The phone is not connected to a Google account (and never has been). The calendar has never been synced with any other device or service. The device has not been rooted.

Expected behavior: Launching `Calendar Import-Export` should allow me to export my local calendar's data.

Actual behavior: When launching `Calendar Import-Export`, I am immediately confronted with a message stating `No calendars found.` (followed by some advise on how to create one). I can only confirm with `OK`. The app exits.

What's happening here? How I can possibly work around this issue?

I've successfully used this excellent app in the past and also recommended it to a number of people.

Unfortunately, I recently stumbled upon a strange problem in the latest version:
I had exported an Offline Calendar with ""Calendar Import-Export V2.5"" on an Android 6.0.1 (CM13) phone. The export ran fine without any errors.

Then I tried to import that exported file on an Android 7.1 (LineageOS 14.1) phone with the same ""Calendar Import-Export V2.5"".

The file contains 720 entries in total and after 557 entries the import process stops and an error message pops up:

        ERROR
        Error:
        For input string: ""T0""

When I downgrade to V2.4 on the target phone, the error does not occur and the import finishes smoothly.

I tried various parameters in the settings to no avail.

However, I noticed another critical issue with both versions:
Full day events that spread across 2 or more days are only shown as a 1-day event after import. That is critical in my opinion.
Was that actually meant to be fixed in V2.5 (that's how I understood the changelog on Github)?
The issue was reported closed in #50

If you know of a calendar app that uses local calendars, and can _actually_ delete events, please post it here!

In order to work around this issue, some popular apps remove the UUID's of events that the user wants to delete.  Even though those events don't actually get deleted in the database, the apps know not to show those events in the calendar.

I prepared everything for a Google Play and F-Droid release. I also re-designed Offline Calender and tested the interoperability via the Intent and fixed it. I think everything is already good enough (tm) for a release. Many people have asked for a backup/restore feature for Offline Calender, so I would like to release ASAP.
We can rework the design of the UI in a later release.
Please also contact me via email, I can give you access to the Google Play dev console for this app.
Are you okay with this?

SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export,open,Add ability to import files containing events from multiple calendars into separate calendars,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","Apps like _Business Calendar_ and _Business Calendar 2_ allow exporting multiple calendars to a single .ics (ical) file.  Actually, due to a misleading UI, they encourage it!

If _ical-import-export_ could process such files and import the data into multiple calendars, that would be an incredible feature.

Those popular apps seem to primarily use `ORGANIZER:CN=[calendar name]` to differentiate which event goes with which calendar.
"
SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export,closed,Library situation,"[Label(name=""discussion"")]","a) Instead of having ""android-support-v4.jar"" inside the libs folder, we should use the one provided by the Android SDK using a proper dependency definition with a version code.

b) I am not sure how to handle the other libs correctly. I think it's good enough for now to include the precompiled jars, but it would be much nicer to rely on libs from JCenter or including them with git submodules. At least we should document how they were build inside the README (I saw your specific instructions in https://github.com/dschuermann/ical-import-export/commit/f50ec5724d6722f0824d59150831a08a9b33547d and https://github.com/dschuermann/ical-import-export/commit/3e36642a15c5195f3372e93d9ca3677a75591a58 )

This pull request is a large set of changes.  It fixes issues #1, #2, #3, #7, #11, #13, #14, #15, #16 and #17 plus a number of bugs without issues, adds a number of new features  and simplifies both the UI and the source code. The app is for me now very usable/useful.

I am intending to make further changes in the future but I thought I would get your comments on the changes so far. If you are happy to pull then I will update the issues on your branch so they can be closed, before starting on the next set of changes.

Please let me know what you think.

SufficientlySecure/calendar-import-export,closed,Imported bug:  Import of multi-line description fields ,[],"What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Attempt to import an ICS with a multi-line description field

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Multi-line description fields have a space in the first position of the second and subsequent lines. For example:

DESCRIPTION:Trip:\nJUL 16-DESTINATION\nDeparts Jul 16\, 20
 11 8:25am Arrives Jul 16\, 2011 12:55pm

The second line starts with a space and should be recognized as a continuation of the DESCRIPTION field. The resulting description should read:

Trip:
JUL 16-DESTINATION
Departs Jul 16, 2011 8:25am Arrives Jul 16, 2011 12:55pm

Instead, the following error message is printed:

Error
iCal file could not be parsed
Error at line xx: illegal property [ 11 6]

This seems to indicate that the importer is treating the continuation line as a new field.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Version 1.5 on Android 2.3

Please provide any additional information below.

Found this:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1755577&group_id=107024&atid=646395

I verified that the ICS file from which I pulled an excerpt above uses LF solely, not CRLF as specified in RFC 2445. So shame on them.

The above iCal4j bug was closed as 'rejected' but it also references a RELAXED_UNFOLDING compatibility hint that will accept LF-only line breaks. Is it possible to get that implemented, either as the default or as an option?

Please provide any additional information below.

I write some own PHP code, so I can influence the generated ICS-code.
What I would like it to accept (and most other progs/Google does) is a file like

BEGIN:VCALENDAR

VERSION:2.0

PRODID:-//Custom written JD//NL

BEGIN:VEVENT

TZNAME:CET

DTSTART:20110624

DTEND:20110625

SUMMARY:Example event

END:VEVENT

END:VCALENDAR

This is valid code for a single day full day event. So untimed DTSTART, DTEND.

I can see the progs accepts:

BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//Custom written JD//NL
BEGIN:VEVENT
TZNAME:CET
DTSTART:20110624T000000
DTEND:20110625T235959
SUMMARY:Example event
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR

But this gives an event between the times mentioned. Which is ugly and gives all sort of problems. For instance when changing to daylight-saving-time, which shifts the event one hour into the next day.

I'm totally new to Android, but would like to load stuff like this in my calendar. 
Found your app, and it looks very nice.

Any resolvement of the issue would be appreciated.
