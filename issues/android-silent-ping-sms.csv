itds-consulting/android-silent-ping-sms,open,Suggestion for improvement,"[Label(name=""waiting for response"")]","If you code the DCS octet as 0xD4 as opposed to 0x04, it will reduce the possibility of the recipient being notified in any way. 

I have a rooted phone (am HTC 10) with the original android PDU library (as it is still is included in stock HTC ROMs), and when I send the message generated by your app, it works insofar as correctly indicating that a phone is offline, but for online phones, I receive a blank message (with the senders number).

0x04 (0000 0100) is an 8-bit class 0 message, and since it is 8-bit, no message displays, but at least on the phones I have tested (a Samsung S3 and an HTC One M8), a blank message is received. Since most people are not going to be able to send a true type 0 message (with the PID octet set to 0x40), an alternative is to set the DCS octet bit 6. This, according to the specs (3GPP 23.038.010 version 10), marks the message for automatic deletion. So the bit coding for DCS becomes 0100 0100 or 0xD4.

In my testing, using this change, I still receive an ACK (or delivery report) but the phone does not receive a blank message with senders number."
itds-consulting/android-silent-ping-sms,closed,Bug on Silent Sms Ping: Clicking On send without adding recipients causes the app to crash. ,[],"
#### Expected behavior
Silent Sms Ping is an open source andriod application which helps secretly send a message to a receiver without notifying the user that the message has been received via notification drop box or any other means. Using Silent Sms ping as explained are to carry specific duties without obstacles. 

#### Actual behavior
Simply Opening the application and clicking send without doing anything else such as adding recipients name or going through history. Just simply clicking on send as soon as the application is opened causes the application to crash which is an error.

#### How to reproduce
* Download Silent Sms Ping from F-driod application. 
* Open the application. 
* Click on send. 
* Application Crashes. 

--------------------------------------------------------

* version of the application : **v 3**
* last updated : **12/4/17**

--------------------------------------------------------

* Browser: F-driod / Sms Ping
* Operating system: Andriod 7.0

I was wondering: if we can send silent text messages, is there a way to check if we're being pinged? Like, a notification is displayed when someone sends us a silent SMS. Or an option to block such messages. 

Is that possible?"

itds-consulting/android-silent-ping-sms,closed,Failed to send request,[],"Worked the first time i installed it, days ago, but not anymore. More exactly it sends messages, as Android warns me about flood when i click many times on the send button, but app seems doing nothing (else than add number to history) and finally i get the error message FAILED TO SEND REQUEST

Between the date it worked and now i installed multiple apps from f-android and gplay (new phone...). And also i opened ingeener menu and did nothing but increase logging verbosity (well im not sure where are the logs located at this point). But not much.

How can i get error messages from SMS Ping and help debug it?
