I have a feature suggestion for the app that would make it more useful for a lot of people. Where i live, most streets doesn't have a name, and as i need to add every place i visited into the calendar, it becomes pretty hard. I need to use Samsung Calendar right now, as it's the only calendar that has this option at the moment that i know of, and it breaks when MicroG is installed.
By adding a button next to the add location text that sets the current location of the phone for the event, a lot more people would use the app (me included), as this would probably the only open-source calendar app that would be able to do this.
Location permission shouldn't be asked at start, only after user presses on the button.

Hi there,

I'm using xiaomi Mi 8 running Android 8.1.0 MIUI 10.0.2.0 and repeatedly get a crash every day when a recurring event reminder should get triggered. The event usually is expected to show in the notification bar and a notification sound I set in the preferences should play (sound was chosen from SD card).
Instead of playing the notification sound, Etar crashes, see log.

Note: I've solved such a problem before in syncthing-android . Android 8+ doesn't allow a file URI built from an absolute path like /storage/emulated/0/Ringtones/buff.ogg to be sent through an intent which worked fine on older Android versions.

Solution suggested: implement SAF for devices running Android 5+ using the file chooser dialog from Storage access Framework Action_get_document which will return a proper URI. Keep the existing way using rooted paths for phone before Android 5.x. 

Similar implementation if you cannot live without rooted paths to look at : https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/pull/1170/files"

But I would love to see the entire task name in Agenda View in full color (just like in Google Calendar) instead of just a colored square to the left of the task.
My reasoning is because I color code different events/tasks so I know what kind they are and don't have to read all of them in detail. Just an idea. I have tried different apps to get away from Google an Etar seems the most promising. Thanks for your hard work!"

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,open,All day events and Timezones (unexpected time offsets),[],"So I use Etar as my calendar, but I have recently been implementing a ""fit everything into a small space"" calendar widget (to replace the unmaintained widget I had previously been using).

Something that surprised me was all day events having unexpected time offsets (not midnight to midnight as I had expected). In my case, all my events seem to have 10 hours added to the start and end times, which unsurprisingly matches my timezone (UTC+10). I'm not yet sure if the events themselves have a timezone set or if it's just the system timezone, or how the system is even supposed to be working...

A side effect of this 10 hour offset is that morning events (eg. my ""catch the train"" even at 7am) were displaying _before_ the ""untimed"" all day event - they come out of the DB first due to sorting by instance start time.

But I realised that I had seen this exact behaviour from Etar too. It displays all day events after any timed events that are before 10am on a given day.

If I find out how this is supposed to be handled (eg. it could be ""find the timezone on the event and subtract the offset from the times"") then I'll update this issue so that Etar can be fixed.

If any Etar devs happen to know how this should be handled, that would be great too."

7. gradle clean & build/close the project and reopen/re-import it.
```

It does not implement any `VTIMEZONE` parsing, but relies on `java.util.TimeZone` to recognize the `TZID` given in the ics-file (which hopefully follows some standard naming conventions).

I'm aware this isn't the best solution, but at least it should handle a wider range of ics files correctly (up to now, only the UTC form is recognized). To support the whole specification, it would be much better to use some third-party ics parsing library, imho.

I am not sure if other time zones have the same issue, but currently time on all my clocks and in my country (and in all central Europe) is the same and they show 8:52. But you've already known that. However, when I check time for CET in Etar it shows 7:52. Next time zone shows 9:52. Where did we lost an hour?

It seems that it still uses summer time, and we changed it last month to winter time. Maybe if it is not possible to changed that by the software, you could let user change it manually.

However, wrong time had been shown during the summertime also. 6:00 would be in Etar, 8:00 on my phone. On the calendar there is no problem. Events are in good position. The problem occurs in the description of an event and in notifications. It's not a bih deal, but It's annoying.

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,closed,DAVdroid & ACCESS_CONFIDENTIAL,[],"Hello Etar-Team,

DAVdroid is an open source sync adapter on Android for CalDAV and CardDAV. We've implemented a new feature recently which would also be cool to use in Calendar apps like Etar.

On the server side a user can already set the visibility for an event (Server default, PUBLIC, PRIVATE or CONFIDENTIAL). On Android only DEFAULT, PUBLIC and PRIVATE are used. But there is a field for CONFIDENTIAL internally. We don't know any calendar app supporting this 4th setting (CONFIDENTIAL). As said before servers already use this, for example Nextcloud and others. It's only missing on the Android side.

Nevertheless this field is now able to be synchronized and stored with DAVdroid, so for the users it would be great if they could edit or create events containing this visibility setting, too. 

We're currently workarounding this as for non-capable calendar apps. It can be read here:

https://www.davdroid.com/manual/#c41

Of course this is just a small enhancement, but it would be great to have :-)

Thank you for your work on Etar!"

I searched ""dark theme calendar"" on DuckDuckGo and it seems like the white bars is the main issue (also using a dark grey instead of solid black could help a lot) since these examples doesn't look that aggressive to the eye. What do you think? sorry if it's too much work and again, thank you so much for your time and dedication!!

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,open,Modifying the date of a series only works on the first item,[],"If I have an event repeating each week and I would like to modify its starting date, I seems that:
* I can do it by finding the first instance of the series, opening it (by choosing to modify all the instances of the series) and editing the starting date.
* If I try to do it by opening any other instance of the series (and choosing to modify all the instances of the series when prompted), the modification of the starting date is not applied. For example, if I have an event every Saturday starting the 26 of August, and modify the whole series by editing the one of the 9 of September (to the value ""_2 of Septemper_""), then the series will still start the 26 of August. Other software I know (ex: KOrganizer in KDE) actually modify the starting date of the series in such a case. Note that if I modify in Etar any other field (time of the day, description), the modification is successful for the whole series."
Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,closed,Cannot run Etar from f-droid the first time,[],"**Scenario**:
- Install Etar from f-droid applications manager
- Launch Etar from f-droid.
- You are asked in a pop-up to give calendar access (click yes)

**Actual result**:
- A ""_screen overlay detected_"" pop-up dialog is displayed, asking me to give Etar such a rights. Click on the button of the pop-up.
- You are redirected to the Android ""_draw over other apps_"" system settings screen but there cannot change the overlay right for Etar
- Leave the settings. Etar is not launched.

**Expected result**:
After having accepted to given the app access to the user calendar, Etar should be fully started.

**Alternative scenario**:
Like the original scenario, but by launching Etar from the Android applications list.

**Additional notes**:
It did not happen all the times when I repeated this scenario (must most of the times). Going in the Android application management and giving the Calendar, Contacts and Storage rights solved the issue. In some other attempts, trying to run the app several times (from the application list) sometimes succeeded (rights were properly added after being prompted).

thank you a lot for developing such a nice open source alternative.

I do not expect this variety at all but it would be nice if I could set the size of the widget and the size of the letters for the head line, time, title, ...

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,open,Feature Request: Reduce portion of night hours & making text smaller (Week),[],"- **Ability to reduce the size of hours X to Y in the week calender**
I always use the week-type calendar. As I obviously have most of my appointments between 9AM and 7PM, I sometimes wish to see these hours easier. I'd love an option in the settings that reduces the ""block-size"" of certain hours (e.g. midnight to 6AM) to the space of one or two blocks, instead of six blocks. Optionally adding a bold line between the timespan that has been reduced in size and the regular hours would be great.

- **Ability to reduce font size of event names in the week calender**
Another option that would be very beneficial is reducing the text size of event names in the week-type calendar. My eyes aren't that bad and although the current font size is not huge at all, I could easily read it if it'd be two sizes smaller, leaving more space for more letters of the event name.

Love the app <3"

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,closed,Fix height in month view,[],"Fixes #158.  I hope I didn't miss any side effects this time since the month view is quite complex.

The height of a box in the month view is calculated [here](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar/blob/master/src/com/android/calendar/month/MonthByWeekAdapter.java#L264) using the formula `(parent.getHeight() + (parent.getTop() * 2)) / (mNumWeeks + 1)`.  The origin of this formula is not clear to me but apparently it sets the height such that _approximately_ `mNumWeeks` boxes are visible.
 
After commit 3ebc9c11fafb3baf212731ec3739ce4ad4c9e583 the toolbar is no longer scrollable and this reduces the result of `parent.getHeight()` leading to the behavior described in #158.  I think the reason is that with a scrollable toolbar the area occupied by the toolbar is included in `parent.getHeight()` since the toolbar could be removed by scrolling.

However, after making the toolbar unscrollable `parent.getHeight()` should give the actual size excluding the area occupied by the toolbar.  Thus, the correct height of the boxes can be calculated by the simple formula `parent.getHeight() / mNumWeeks` as done in this pull request.

This does not restore the exact original behavior but the height of the boxes is now calculated such that `mNumWeeks=6` boxes (and a tiny bit more if you look carefully) are visible.  In the original behavior approximately `mNumWeeks=6` boxes were visible (afaik it can be either more or less depending on the resolution). For comparison see the following screenshots.

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,closed,Permission READ_PHONE_STATE declared but not used,[],"Hello, I'm Denis Bogdanas, a research assistant at Oregon Stat University.
I'm working on a tool that automatically introduces runtime permission checks and requests for Android 6 apps. As part of this study I analyzed this app. I was looking at the way permissions are referred in the code.

This app declares permission READ_PHONE_STATE in the apk manifest, but doesn't have any code that requires them. It is possible that source code doesn't declare the permissions. I only analyzed apk builds from f-droid. Yet android build mechanism may introduce them when the app uses certain libraries:

https://commonsware.com/blog/2015/06/25/hey-where-did-these-permissions-come-from.html

It won't create any problems on Android 6, but on Android 5- users may wonder why the app needs these permissions and be skeptical of installing the app.

Do you think this is an issue?

best regards,
Denis

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,open,Days per week setting yields unexpected behavior,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","In ""week view"" with the default ""days per week"" setting of 7 a swipe left or right moves the view to the next week with the days (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) in the same position. If the ""days per week"" setting is modified to 5 (so that more width is available per day) then swiping left or right causes the positions of the days to constantly change. This is visually inconsistent and makes the setting somewhat unusable (in my view).

It would be more intuitive if the week view was not forced to scroll by the amount specified in ""days per week"" but rather just smooth scrolled. Then when I scroll to the next week I can maintain a consistent position of the the days (i.e. Monday/Sunday on the left) or just choose whatever I feel I want. The app is forcing the position of the days which is annoying (in my view).

I can understand if this is the desired behavior. Maybe you can just add a setting for ""smooth scroll week view"".

This is a bug in the library [com.android.datetimepicker](https://github.com/xsoh/android_frameworks_opt_datetimepicker/tree/a62b3c24ea7bedc32de00567e430a706a6ec135c).

Fortunately this has been fixed in the CyanogenMod repository from which this library is forked from (it should also be fixed in your fork but not in the version included in this project).  Reading the commit log, [this](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_opt_datetimepicker/commit/3fc32c45f5efc4ce4b91cbcdd925d9b30f67046e) should be the commit fixing this problem.  I compiled Etar with the [current version](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_opt_datetimepicker/tree/66a7685e2e9a524989f840bd13217beeb3fc6342) (66a7685 at the time of writing) of datetimepicker and checked that the problem is indeed fixed.

So it would be great if you could update datetimepicker to fix this.

Note that the current version of datetimepicker requires a small change in Etar to work.  The version you use defines the color `@color/white`but this was later [removed](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_opt_datetimepicker/commit/a09b3c940e98b8606a16a94b48b6d0121d9d3635) since it is already included in android as `@android:color/white`.  However, you use `@color/white` in res/values/styles.xml and res/values/themes.xml, so these should also be replaced with `@android:color/white`.  Apart from that I did not encounter any problems with the new version.

- Etar's refresh does not trigger DAVdroid sync with an external server.

To be honest, I don't know, if it's DAVdroid's or Etar's issue or both. I'm guessing Etar's because everything works well with the regular Android Calendar app.

The DTSTART (DTEND) values it writes to the Calendar Provider contain arbitrary seconds, i.e. if you enter start time ""13:00"", Etar writes ""13:00:38"" to the Calendar Provider.

I guess this is because the `Date` is created from the current time, and then the second is not set to zero.

I'm also seeing this on the AOSP Calendar that builds with AOSP-6.0.0, so it's probably some change in Marshmallow.

do you really need android.permission.INTERNET in AndroidManifest.xml? A quick grep turned up nothing. Would be great to get rid of it.

Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar,closed,More visible entries in month view,[],"Hey, really nice work here! I've been looking forward to a nice OSS Calender for quite a long time. Keep it up!

I think the month view could be further improved by reducing the paddings and margins around an appointment.
Thus, more Entries would be visible.
(aCalender does this)

Example: (aCalendar VS Ethar)

At first, thanks for your application. 

My question is if you could add k9-mail E-Mail Account support or if that would be rather impossible due to k9-mails' behavior not to add it's held accounts in the ""Android Account Manager""?

Thank you very much for your work until now and in advance for your feedback.
