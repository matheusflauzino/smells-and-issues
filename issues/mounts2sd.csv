SpazeDog/mounts2sd,open,API Compatibility Issues,[],"Dear developers,

We have recently developed a state-of-the-art static analysis tool for uncovering API compatibility issues in Android apps. Applying this tool to open source apps on F-droid, we have exposed a few instances of compatibility issues and submitting them to development teams for a fix. 

For your app, we have found that this project has accessed the following APIs which are available only on an API level higher than the declared minSdkVersion and which are accessed without proper protection. In other words, if those APIs get called at runtime, it will trigger a NoSuchMethodError and thus result in a crash of the running application.

<android.app.FragmentManager: android.app.FragmentTransaction beginTransaction()>:[11,25]
<android.app.FragmentTransaction: int commit()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onPause()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void setRetainInstance(boolean)>:[11,25]
<android.app.FragmentManager: android.app.Fragment findFragmentByTag(java.lang.String)>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onDestroy()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onStart()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onCreate(android.os.Bundle)>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onAttach(android.app.Activity)>:[11,25]
<android.content.SharedPreferences.Editor: void apply()>:[9,25]
<android.app.Fragment: android.app.FragmentManager getChildFragmentManager()>:[17,25]
<android.app.Activity: android.app.FragmentManager getFragmentManager()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void onResume()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: android.app.Activity getActivity()>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: android.app.Fragment getParentFragment()>:[17,25]
<android.app.FragmentTransaction: android.app.FragmentTransaction add(android.app.Fragment,java.lang.String)>:[11,25]
<android.app.Fragment: void <init>()>:[11,25]

Note that, because of the nature of the static analysis, we cannot confirm whether the flagged APIs would actually be called at runtime (e.g., unreachable code). However, we still believe that those APIs, which may cause compatibility issues, should not be accessed or at least be accessed with proper protections. 

In addition to the aforementioned APIs (i.e., backward-compatibility), which could cause app crashes if accessed, we have also identified that this project has also accessed some APIs that have been removed from the latest public SDK, making the app possibly suffer from forward-compatibility issues.

NONE

We would be very much appreciated if you can acknowledge to us that those reported APIs are indeed problematic for the project’s long-term stability. please let us know if you need any more information relating to this issue report.

You need to stop zram first, reset its value, then start it again with new value (this is what this patch do). However, UI still reports ZRAM as ""disabled"", apparently the app itself needs a fix.

SpazeDog/mounts2sd,open,Recomended app/cache cleaning tools with Mounts2SD,[],"I am loving Mounts2SD, after struggling with link2sd over 3 reinstalls i found this app and it works better than i hoped

i am using HTC Desire-Bravo, managed to get Liquid smooth on android 4.4.4 which is running great.

my usage of ur app is Cache enabled, all content options ticked, the 4gb SD is seperated into fat32 SD and 1.48gb ext4 partition.

i have been using SD maid, CM cleanmaster and ES task manager to clean cache and junk data out of the phone, but the last time the extended partition was broken (link2sd) was due to a cleaner program running and it entirely broke everything, needed to wipe and restart. im certiain it was CM cleanmaster that did it.

My question is which of these cleaning programs would you think safe to use in the phone without breaking Mounts2SD or the partition.

im scared to run any of them now :S , this old phone is as good as new and i want it to stay running smooth.

Thankyou for any advice you can give :D

Mount to SD has full root permissions.

In the configuration section it says that the ext4 driver is enabled, although all other options are greyed out. It also has a message in a yellow box saying ""could not locate the SD-EXT partition.

A year latter but maybe I can help add more information to have this fixed for a similar problem.

I am using Mount2SD(v3.48) on T-mobile Galaxy S2 (SGH-T989) with CM10.2. I am getting similar messages:

```
W/Not everything from '/data/data' could be moved to '/sd-ext/data'
W/Not everything from '/data/user' could be moved to '/sd-ext/user'
```

Some more information to help debug the problem:
1. I looked at these directories by booting into recovery (i.e. before Mounts2SD mounts partitions):
[x] /data/user as a file called '0' as already mentioned which is just a symlink to /data/data
[x] /data/data seems to be populated with data for system apps
1. If the directories above are emptied (I backed up first though the data seemed mostly redundant only 980 kbytes of files in total and mostly empty directories) Mounts2SD again still gives the same error in the log.
2. Something seems to be generating the data in the above directories before the Mounts2SD script launches because I seem to have the two directories repopulated again. Its almost as though CM10.2 thinks that it has just been freshly installed and thinks that it needs to populate the data directory for first time boot.
3. Ofcourse the Warning don't affect normal working of the phone as the mount still completes and Only I want this to be fixed for completeness.
4. Additional observation. not sure if related: Once booted /sd-ext/data has the symlink '0' !? Even if I delete it, it get regenerated on next boot. Note that this symlink '0' is not in the /data/data directory in the internal memory before boot even in the repopulated /data/data. Not sure how the data is being copied by the Mounts2SD script but I suspect that there is some recursion or link following going on since the symlink '0' points to /data/data

I hope all this is making sense. I can clarify any questions you have or explain further if you like.

Thanks

If it helps for other nexus devices running CM10.x, I think the block devices are handled through /dev/block/vold directory. In my case there are 3 files: 8:0, 8:1, and 8:2 in there that also reference the USB stick. It seems vold it still used even in nexus with JB4.2 (at least for CM10.x)

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1811325

When m2sd starts posts ""There is no startup script present on your device.  Go to application settings and install it.""  When I go into settings and click the Install Startup Script I get the following:
""Your device is S-On protected which means that the application cannot write to the system partition from within Android.  Do you want to launch the recovery fallback handler?""

Clicking ""Okay"" copies files into /data/local/ and reboots into CWM recovery and attempts to install the zip.  It fails with ""signature verification failed.""

""Show log"" from CWM recovery shows the following:

Finding update package...
I:Update location: /data/local/fallback.zip
Opening update package...
I:1 key(s) loaded from /res/keys
Verifying update package...
I:verify_file returned 1
E:signature verification failed
Installation aborted.

I went to look for a /res/keys file and while there is a /res directory there is no keys file.  I can disable the key check, but I can't get back to the zip in /data/local/ after I disable the key check...

Any suggestions?

SpazeDog/mounts2sd,open,Force close with the new update,[],"Hello,

I have a HTC Wildfire S with Cyanogenmod 10.1 (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2248654). It worked perfectly, but after the last update of Mounts2SD, it began to force close lots of processes and the phone was unstable. After a clean reinstall of the rom, Mounts2SD force closes when trying to collect the device configuration.

Should I attach the entire logcat of the full booting process? Or just the portions related to Mounts2SD?

Thank you for your great application :)
