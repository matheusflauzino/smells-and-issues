philliphsu/ClockPlus,open,alarm problems in Android 9,[],"The alarm doesn't work intermittently in Android Pie. It never works if the do-not-disturb (alarms allowed) is on and sometimes even after I turn the d-n-d off it still doesn't work.

This used to work in Android 8. Android 9 made changes to how the d-n-d is handled.

I confirmed that the system clock alarm still works in d-n-d mode, so it is the app rather than the mode.

Love the application, hope this can be fixed. Happy to help test if need be."

The app crashes when attempting to enter the first number in a timer.

This appears to be because the cursor is right of the rightmost digit in the hours field by default.

I can work around this by touching any of the fields (including the hours field) before entering numbers. Which moves the cursor to the far left of the selected field.

## Expected
Typing a number in the hours field without any additional interaction changes the number of hours for the timer.

## Environment
* Samsung Galaxy S8 Active
* Android 8.0
* Clock+ 1.1.3 via FDroid (also happens with the version in the Google Play store)

philliphsu/ClockPlus,open,[feature/enhancement] Slider or timed button when alarm beeps,[],"Hello,
First of all thanks for clock+, i think it's one of the best clock app i've found on F-Droid so far :-)

Here is an enhancement suggestion:
When an alarm beeps, the screen is activated and there is two big buttons sharing the space, snooze and stop. One tap on a button immediately trigger the action.

This is fine, but it is often too sensitive : For example, when the alarm beeps in my pocket, the alarm is often snoozed/stopped (by accident) when I try to take my phone off my pocket. Also, when I use an alarm to wake up, I try to grab the phone near the bed, and I almost always tap the screen inadvertently when searching it on the table (and it snooze or stop the alarm before i can decide what I want to do).

Should it be possible to modify the alarm screen to be less prone to manipulation errors?
I can suggest two ways of doing that: Either replace the buttons by sliders (for example, slide to right to stop, slide to left to snooze), or even simpler: add a timer on each button (for example, stop/snooze button must be pressed continuously at least 2 seconds to activate it).

Thanks a lot :-)"

philliphsu/ClockPlus,open,[bug?] faced unreliable wake times,[],"After facing the DST bug (https://github.com/philliphsu/ClockPlus/issues/15), followed by the snooze bug (https://github.com/philliphsu/ClockPlus/issues/19), I realized one morning (woke up already, looking at my phone), that the alarm - which started in this second - came up round about 20 Minutes after it was set.

I search around a bit and found, that there is 'Doze' since Android 6.0, which sends some background processes to sleep to save energy...
So I added ClockPlus to the whitelist over:
Settings -> Battery -> three-dot-menu -> Battery optimization -> All apps -> ClockPlus -> don't optimize
And since then the reliability of the alarms is back (in my case).

No I saw there is a specific command 'setAlarmclock()' instead of 'set()':
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32492770/how-to-make-alarm-manager-work-when-android-6-0-in-doze-mode#32511496
and I wanted to ask if this could probably help to fix this behaviour without putting the app on the Doze-whitelist on Android devices 6.0+. By the way, I'm using AOSP 7.1.1 (on Samsung I9300).
