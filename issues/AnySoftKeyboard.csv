Trying to gesture type this title I end up with: ""Setoff gesturer toping accuracy improvements"". 

For the most part prediction doesn't seem to take into account likely next words and often chooses uncommon words compared to the other potential words which have the same gesture pattern (eg always getting ""tressed"" instead of ""test""). 

I'm also not sure if this feature learns and improves for each user over time, but for the short time I've tested it repeatedly doing the same words I haven't found a discernible improvement. "

2. Add a space after the word, ie ans .
3. Backspace that space, and the first letter of the word gets doubled: aans

The first letter of the word is doubled, and auto-correct seems to forget about the double letter, and will auto-correct the complete word after the doubled letter(s) at the beginning. This makes me backspace the entire word or move cursor to the doubled letter(s) at the beginning to fix that word.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Make the method of setting the priority of keyboards more explicit,[],"For a good while I thought there's no way to set which language/layout should be the default out of the enabled ones. Thought (and experienced) that it always takes QWERTY English as default.

Then I realized that in ""Language"" -> ""Enable keyboards and languages"", keyboards can be dragged if they are long-tapped, and their order can be changed. This makes me assume that the order set up there sets the priority, so that if I drag Keyboard X to the first spot (and Keyboard X is enabled), it will treat X as the default, and my preference doesn't have to be changed manually in every app. Am I correct in assuming this?

If yes, then the process by which the priority is set should be made more explicit. Probably a different method should be devised.

1. It is not obvious that you can enable/disable keyboards by tapping on them.
2. But more importantly, it's not obvious *at all* that you can drag keyboards on the list, change their position and that their position determines the priority of keyboards, and with that, the default keyboard used all over the system.

For point 1, I propose having an empty checkbox for disabled keyboards, to communicates that the keyboards in question can be enabled. I further propose making the preview image of the disabled keyboards more transparent and/or grayscale to emphasize that keyboards can be enabled and disabled.

For point 2, which is the greater potential source of confusion, I propose abandoning the present dragging system and devising another way to set priority. For example, you could make another menu in ""Language"" which explicitly states that you can set the priority there by dragging. In that menu, keyboards would appear only by name in one line, items could be dragged, and each item would have the ""dragging symbol"" (three parallel horizontal lines) flushed to the right side of the box to make usage clearer. You could also have disabled keyboards there, so priority won't be lost when disabling/enabling keyboards,  but disabled keyboards should be displayed in a different way (e.g. in gray color)."

English pronouns separated with white space. It's easy to store them in
separated word value (in dictionary). Indonesian pronouns are
combined, so ASK will always store it in dictionary, because ASK
thinks that they are new words. This will make our dictionary full of
the same meaning word just with additional pronouns.

What your opinion on this ?

Can we tell ASK in indonesian-mode that those words are just pronouns
? (expanded from base word)

Watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j74jcxSunY)
video. It's hard to design our app to support all languages
style. Maybe for now, the easiest way is to store all those words as
new word. Also because I see that Indonesian Language has lot of pronouns,
additions, prefixes, suffixes. oh no :)

Thanks for ASK

The keys stay the same as when they were unshifted.

I'm asking this because I would like to have a more refined bottom row layout with some specific symbols. However, this row layout would only be useful and work well with a specific language, so adding these in ASK's default bottom rows would not make sense. I'm aware that it's possible to specify a bottom row in the `keyboards.xml` of the LanguagePack template, but this means that the user can't then change the bottom row from the ASK settings because the language pack is overriding it.

The same goes for the built-in symbol layout. Different languages have different conventions and use different symbols. It would be the best to have language-specific symbol layouts defined in the language packs. It's rather cumbersome to cram all the possible symbols used in a language to the standard letter layout (even with pop-ups)."

Until the previous update I would add words to the dictionary as per the usual method, and then the app would remember them and not autocorrect (ie ""lol"" would not be autocorrected to ""mol"" after I'd added ""lol"" to the dictionary).

### Actual behaviour
Since the update two issues have arisen. The first is that (despite still appearing in the dictionary in the app itself) the keyboard does not remember most or all saved words (cannot confirm if it is all of them, but it has been a large number of confirmed saved words).

When I attempt to add/re-add a word to the dictionary list the ""Touch again to save"" prompt is unresponsive. No matter how many times it has been attempted it no longer saves words.

When I opened the dictionary to see if the words had all been erased, they were all present. For a brief period the keyboard returned to correctly remembering the words, before reverting once again to having forgotten all of them (over the course of all of this, however, I have been unable to add new saved words).

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Improve capitalization in next word suggestion,[],"Currently (I'm running v1.9.1117 from F-Droid), the behavior is to always suggest lower-case words, even if I've always typed a certain combination with mixed case.

Typing 'N' makes the suggestion vanish, and I have to type around four letters till it appears again, to get something I should have gotten with just one tap 🙂

I can think of two possible solutions for this -
1. Control the capitalization of the next word suggestion with the Shift key. That is, if I type 'Lajpat' and 'nagar' is suggested, tapping Shift should make the suggestion 'Nagar', and tapping Shift again should change it back to lowercase. Double-tapping Shift could capitalize either the first letter ('Foo', as above) or all letters ('FOO') of all suggestions (until Shift is tapped again).

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,[Feature Request] Support for Chinese (and possibly other languages such as Japanese),[],"I recently discovered this keyboard alternative and love it because it's libre/open source :)

I was wondering if ASK could be used to input languages like Chinese or Japanese.

For Chinese, there are different ways of entering text. A popular way is to type [Hanyu Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) (a standardized transliteration system) of the character/words that you want, and the select the words in a list.

For example: I type `wo` and I can select characters such as `我` `沃` `卧` `窩`... (all pronounced ""wo"").

I had a look at the source code on how to create new language packages, but it looks like it's based on a matches between letters (e.g. if I start typing ""fr"", I'll have access to words in the dictionary starting with/containing `fr`).

That means for languages such as Chinese, we would need an intermediate state in the dictionary or somewhere else to make the connection between:

1. what the user types (e.g. `fagu`),
2. what pinyin it can match, (e.g. `faguo`)
3. and therefore what Chinese character(s) it could match (e.g. ""法國"", ""faguo"").

There are a lot of other subtleties (see below), but what I described above is the core of the issue.

Could a language pack be created for this kind of language? Would it require changes in ASK itself?

Cheers and thanks again!

# Other subtleties to take into account

## Written and spoken Chinese

(I will simplify for the sake of brevity, if you are a Chinese speaker, please bear with me!)

There are two forms of written Chinese:

* Simplified Chinese (used in China); for instance, 法国 is the simplified Chinese for ""France""
* Traditional Chinese (used in Taiwan and Hong Kong); 法國 is the Traditional Chinese for ""France""

That should not be a problem if ASK can have two different dictionaries.

On top of that, there are two main spoken Chinese variants:

* Mandarin (used in China and Taiwan) 
* Cantonese (used in Hong Kong and Macau)

## Romanization and other transliteration methods

In order to simplify the learning process, China started using a romanization method called [hanyu pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin). Each character can be romanized with a syllable and a tone.

For instance, the word ""France"" in Mandarin can be romanized `fǎ gúo` (that is: `fa` with 3rd [tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Tones) and `guo` with the 2nd tone).

In Taiwan, pinyin was never a thing, and instead children are learning Chinese using the [bopomofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo) method, which uses a system of syllables. Using this system, ""France"" in Mandarin can be written `ㄈㄚˇ ㄍㄨㄛˊ`.

The good news is that there are automated methods to turn a hanyu pinyin romanization into a bopomofo set of syllable and vice-versa.

I am not sure how Cantonese is romanized.

## Input methods

Typing Chinese on an electronic device has proven complicated for a long time. There are many, [many ways of typing Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_input_methods_for_computers). 

For hanyu pinyin, since the tones like ˇ or ˊ are not readily available on a qwerty keyboard, they are replaced with their associated number. `fǎ gúo` then becomes `fa3guo2`. But because typing the tones all the time can be quite laborious, many input methods accept the form `faguo` and will present you a list of Chinese characters of words containing these syllables (not necessarily with the right tones). It's then up to the user to select the character/word he wants. Some methods are guessing the word based on the context or based on the previous/following character.

The process is very similar in bopomofo.

## Dictionaries

Fortunately for us, there are some very good dictionaries such as [CC-CEDICT](https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/start) which is available under CC BY-SA license and that includes both traditional and simplified Chinese characters as well as the Mandarin pronunciation in hanyu pinyin (see their [syntax wiki page](https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/format:syntax) for more info).

That means we could create a dictionary for our needs, based on this one, that would include everything needed to type a word (using either pinyin or bopomofo method) and get the associated character(s) (either in its simplified or traditional form)."

- Fix spacing and delete for input types (ex: chromium url bar) that don't do auto space
- Delete whole word when deleting a gesture
- Fix shift, caps lock and finishing a gesture by pressing shift

I undid your TextState changes. This implementation has the advantage of working correctly for the cases above (especially the chromium url bar), but it is definitely an abuse of the states. I am not sure how else to implement it though, so I am definitely open to ideas. The tests should handle any regressions if you want to play around with it.

Everything related to gesturing should be inside the withGestureTyping class, which should hopefully make it less awful than the last PR. Also, everything has a check, so this should not introduce any regressions if the feature flag is disabled.

```
The input connection doesn't have to delete text and re paste it, just for the suggestions to work. Please consider using `setComposingRegion` or something else.

This current mechanism causes several problems: flickering upon moving the cursor, problems with styled text (for example in facebook), and the following problem:

### Steps to reproduce
0. Enable ""_suggestions restart_"" in the keyboard settings.
1. Compose a new message in **Gmail**
2. Write some words (with spaces between them)
3. double click some words several times until the bug happens.

### Expected behaviour
Double clicking a word should select it.

### Actual behaviour
Sometimes the word is **deleted** from the input.

I'm using v1.8.1333 from F-Droid, and have noticed that since quite a while, ASK has had an emoji key which, on short-press, inserts '😃', and on long-press shows the emoji selection menu. I find this an odd choice, as I'm invariably reaching for the menu far, far more often than using that one particular emoji.

I'd like to suggest the following possible behaviours -
- short-press opens the emoji menu, long-press is user-customizable, letting the user jump to a certain section of emojis directly, OR
- short-press jumps to the history section of the menu, long-press jumps to the last-open section in the menu (as it does now)."

2.  Either double-tap _or long-press_ the shift key.

### Expected behaviour
The keyboard should enter caps-lock (all letters will be capitalized until you hit the capitalization/shift key again).

### Actual behaviour
The gesture is ignored; nothing happens. If you long press, the app registers it as a short press. If you double-tapped, the app registers it as two slow single taps (turns to lower case, then turns back to capital letter mode.

I'm currently using [Fleksy](https://fleksy.com/) and it using swipe gesture editing, which would be great to have in this keyboard too. [video demo](https://youtu.be/GqjJ-JNcFGk?t=41s)

Basically the missing gestures actions are:

- [ ] Delete last word
- [ ] Last suggestion or add to dictionary

And that's it!

I don't just think of AnySoftKeyboard as a keyboard, it's an input solution. And if the microphone is one such source, then a camera should be equally as available. I'm using the F-Droid version of AnySoftKeyboard.

Replace the microphone button with a ""Scan button"" that launches the ZXing Barcode Scanner.
Upon scan, have data returned/""pasted""(because the Barcode Scanner copies to clipboard) to the original field AnySoftKeyboard had focus.

Feature accessed: Could be by default, or from ""Common Bottom Row"" choice, or from long-pressing the microphone(or vice versa).

**Precondition**: User is using a mobile browser of any type, about to focus on a text field.

1. User focuses on a text field.
2. AnySoftKeyboard pops up.
2. User presses Scan button.
3. User is taken to Barcode Scanner.
4. User scans a barcode.
5. Successful scan returns user to their previous application, pasting the copied data.

**Postcondition**: User just scanned a barcode into the app of their choice, from an open source keyboard, using an open source barcode scanner, _practically seamlessly._

It is unlikely that a single IME excels at all aspects of (multilingual) text entry, e.g. it might be great for swiping Livonian, but suck at voice typing Võro. Thus an IME should allow the (multilingual) user to quickly switch to another IME (and the other IME should similarly allow the user to switch back to the initial IME).

Newer versions of Android (v5+) make IME switching simpler than before. One needs to tap the (IME-independent) keyboard icon in the lower (or upper, in case of landscape) right corner and then tap a radio button in the ""Change keyboard"" dialog that pops up. Even quicker (and with much less cognitive load) is to tap a globe/keyboard button integrated into the active IME. This button should call switchToNextInputMethod with ""false"" on the 2nd argument.

2. Google Voice Typing pops up

### Expected behaviour
The user should be asked (in the settings or upon pressing the mic button) which form of voice typing they want to use. In general, there are 3 different possible forms: SpeechRecognizer service, RecognizerIntent activity, IME (with voice subtype). Each of these can have multiple installed implementations on Android. The user should be given a choice.

### Actual behaviour
If Google's infrastructure is not installed on the device (e.g. CyanogenMod without Google Play services) then RecognizerIntent pops up. (That's a sensible behavior, although a SpeechRecognizer service based solution would be nicer, like done in SlideIT keyboard.) However, if Google's infrastructure is on the device (e.g. Nexus 5X) then no choice is given.

### Steps to reproduce
1. set the language to french
2. write in french
3. any time it use an apostrophe in the word, the word is correcting in another word, but a wrong one.

### Expected behaviour
Tell us what should happen
The apostrophe (or single quotation mark) hasn't to be recognised as a mistake.

### Actual behaviour
Tell us what happens instead
All words with apostrophe are recognised as wrong and are automatically change in other words.
e.g ""je n'ai pas d'idée"" which means ""I have no idea"" is corrected to ""je n'ai pas sniffée"" ""I didn't snort"" (drugs), and ""n'ai"" are not corrected because I already ""add"" it as a new word in the dictionary.
It is really annoying to add all the dictionary 3 times or more. I can't explain, demonstrate how much we use apostrophe in sentences, just for ""aimer"" (love) with some combination : j'aime l'application, t'aimes l'application, l'application t'aime, ... And for the negative way : je n'aime pas, tu n'aimes pas, ...
(translation : I like the application, you like the application, the application likes you, I don't like, you don't like)
We can make a lot of combination with word and apostrophe, I agree French has an horrible grammar, but I think turning all ""apostrophed"" words into another word is a serious brake on the distribution of Anysoftkeyboard in the french speaking country.

On the other hand both the Samsung and Hacker keyboards can print the proper ""ş"", proper meaning that the letter ""ş"" corresponds to the actual letter code therefor the dictionaries list the right words with this letter. 

Given that we do not have a separate Turkish keyboard and the rest of the turkish letters on the keyboard works, I assume the turkish alphabet is supported by the keyboard.

„Straße” -> „Strasse”
„Verfügung” -> „Vertagung”
„Änderungen” -> „Wanderungen”

Before I downloaded the last version the suggested words worked excellent, always suggested the most closer words for what I wanted to use, its guesses was highly accurate.

### Actual behaviour
Now as I typing words the quality of the suggestions are low are pretty low. Like I type
**let** for let's, but the suggested words I got: _lethal, lets, letters, lettings,_ let's...
**don** for don't, but the suggested words I got: _Donaldson, Donahue, donors, donkey, donald, donate, done, donations,_ don't... (I don't even have any Donaldson or Donahue in my conctact list)
**beli** for believe, but the suggested words I got: _believable, bell, belies, belief, belitted, believes, believer, believed, believing, beliefs,_ believe...
**typ** for typing, but the suggested words I got: _typhoons, typically, typifies, typical, type, typography, typhoon,_ typing
**tou** for touch, but the suggested words I got: _toughened, touching, tourists, tourist, tourism, tour, touched, touches, though,_ touch... 
**thou** for thought, but the suggested words I got: _thoughtful, thousand, though, thoughts, thoughtfully,_ thought...
**thro** for through, but the suggested words I got: _theo, throwing,_ through

It's just a few from the most used words where I want type something and the suggestion give seriously  different words, and most of time I have to scroll a lof to find a word I would like to use.... I don't want to show myself like somebody who always complain or are lazy, but this worked pretty well before the last update, and now it isn't.

See as I wrote in the examples, like the ""don"" for don't, that's the worst one, but not the last like that. As english isn't my original language the correct suggestions are pertty important to me, make my typing faster and easier.
Can you correct it and restore it as it was before? Thank you.

1. Set Split/Merge Initial State to ""Start split in landscape""
2. In portrait mode, tap in a field to open keyboard
3. You see the proper behavior of no split
4. Turn the phone to landscape
5. It is not split. ok, it just says ""STARTS split"", i understand.
6. Turn it BACK to portrait.
7. It is SPLIT!

The same thing happens starting in the other state. Start in landscape, switch to portrait then back to landscape, it is NOT SPLIT!

I am using Cyanogenmod 13 on a Nexus 5X.

This is just not the intended consequence of the setting. It should stay split in landscape all the time if i start split in landscape.

I suggest you add another option to the setting ""Keep split in landscape and regular in portrait"". Isn't that what most people would want anyway? I can't imagine wanting LESS room for the keys in portrait anyway... I would make my new option the default.

OR, why not just create two settings, one that sets the starting state in portrait and the other that sets the starting state in landscape? Then keep the current state for each in a flag bit until the next keyboard opens...

OR add another setting ""Remember last split/merge state for each orientation""...

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,"Rename Words ""full-screen"" to ""full-screen editor"" and Match Dark/Light in Editor",[],"The use of the words in the settings ""Use portrait full-screen"" and ""Use landscape full-screen"" were confusing to me. For a while I thought it was referring to the default length of the keyboard (split or regular) and so I ended up turning on and dealing with the horribly disruptive ""full-screen"" mode and not understanding why. In some apps it would open a huge ugly white full screen editor, blocking important visibility in the app, and abruptly changing themes on me as I have dark theme on in a lot of apps and the full-screen editor is always white.

The full-screen editor is very bad in messaging apps as you can not read the conversation history while you type. Interestingly, In Signal and Whatsapp the full screen editor works but in Telegram Messenger it does not. These are all open source apps so the code could be examined to see why.

I recommend renaming the setting ""full-screen"" to ""full-screen editor"" to make it clearer what is actually full-screen... or maybe there is another way to explain it.

In my programs which have a dark theme, the abrupt change to white is a problem, it is ugly and disruptive. The editor should match with dark or light depending on the app it is opening within, if this is even possible."

Some users never ever want to use voice input, for whatever reason. For these users the key with the microphone is taking up space and is not only non-functional, it could be used in a functional way.

I would like to propose that the popup dialog ""Voice is Not Installed"" offers a third option (a wide button) below the two existing choices called: ""Never show voice, show hyphen instead"". And the text below: ""Showing hyphen key instead of voice key can be undone via AnySoftKeyboards settings.""

When the user chooses ""Never show voice, show hyphen instead"", a key with a hyphen is shown instead of the microphone key. When the user goes into settings menu of anySoftKeyboard, there would be always a boolean setting called  ""Never show voice key, show hyphen key instead"" which is off/false by default. When the choice discussed above has been chosen, this boolean will be set to on/true. The user can manipulate this setting and the effect can be seen on the keyboard.

Implementing this will improve the speed of using the hyphen, which is very common in certain languages or contexts, especially for users that never ever want to use voice input.

Now as for my feature request as the title already says it would be great to have a way of continuing to display word suggestions and/or corrections when using a physical keyboard combined with the option to hide the virtual keyboard after the first 'physical' input.

As a further enhancement of that it would immensely help productivity when picking/controlling the then so displayed suggestions/corrections could be controlled via keyboard shortcuts as to avoid being forced to touch the screen to say select a specific entry .

Would it be possible to add an HTC_IME-style theme to AnySoft Keyboard?

My favorite Android keyboard was the HTC_IME Mod found in these XDA threads:

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1844512
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1594642

It was my go-to KB for speed and ease-of-use. The taller keys allowed displaying larger long-press functions. It was much easier to read, even on smaller displays.

The HTC_IME Mod keyboards quit working when I upgraded to my N5 running KitKat. Smart Keyboard is close, and Tswipe is even closer. However, neither is an open source solution.

Your theme ""Simple black glow"" is very close; to match the HTC_IME concept, the main text letters on the keys would have to be lowered to allow enlarging the function key text above them. The keys could also have their height increased slightly too.

I'm also attaching a screenshot of the HTC KB layout.

- in ASK version 1.8.84 (v1409) it cycles through available keyboards
- conclusion: I can't have one gesture to cycle between alphabet and symbols on one keyboard (I have to have two gestures: Next alphabet keyboard and Next symbols keyboard)

(Found in [API guide](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-cn/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html#execute%28Params...%29)) So that abbreviation dictionary will be loaded after loading main dictionary finished.

Use executeOnExecutor instead will schedule tasks to real multiple threads and speed up this process.

I am having problems on my new phone with the application.

For some reason on Hebrew when I use Brackets (), it enters the wrong one.
So, instead of (test) it writes )test( - this is just an example in English, so you know what I'm talking about :)

Any ideas?

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Please return back ŗ and ō for Latvian layout,[],"### Steps to reproduce
1. Set up Latvian layout for keyboard
2. Check that no letters with diacritics marks are provided for r and o letters
### Expected behaviour

Letters ŗ and ō were removed from Latvian language during Soviet times.
Even reasoning was that it will make writing simpler, it actually worsened language rules because ""simplification"" added inconsistencies in many rules:
1. In consonant flexion (e.g. **egLe**, **egĻu**, and also should be: **vaRa**, **vaŖu**, not **vaRa**, **vaRu**),
2. homonyms where they should not be (e.g. **vaRu**, **vaŖu**, **gaRa**, **gaŖa** are different words),
3. no consistency how o is pronunciated (e.g. **koks** can be spelled as ""_kuoks_"" or ""_koks_"", **borons** is actually spelled as ""_borōns_"", etc.)
### Actual behaviour

Keyboard should propose entering diacriticized letters **ŗ** and **ō** for **r *\* and **o** accordingly.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Allow to switch dictionnaries the same way as keyboard layouts,[],"This is a feature request. Right now keyboard layout and dictionaries are considered more or less independent (each layout has a preferred dicitonary, but that's it). However, in some cases it'd be nice to switch to another dictionary the same way as of keyboard layout (eg, left/right swift on the space key).
There are two cases, which I both face:
- Some languages (eg, Dutch) use the US keyboard layout, so they don't have their own layout. Still, it'd be nice to switch between Dutch and English the same way as you switch between German and English.
- Some languages have keyboard layouts so similar but with small differences that it's annoying to have the layout changed just because you're writting in a different language. For instance, I prefer to write French and English with the same (US) keyboard layout, the same way that it works on a physical keyboard.

So it'd be nice to either:
- Be able to switch dictionaries by swift on the space key or via the ""world"" key
- Be able to ""create"" new keyboard layouts by selecting a layout and a dictionary.

However, I think that suggestions could be handled in a different way, kinda like AOSP keyboard does.

Accented characters should be handled like standard letters. Let me give you an exemple : 
If I tap ""ca"", then suggestions should show me ""ça"" in first entry because ""ca"" does not exist in French, and then the first thing suggestions should tell me is ""ça"" which is a common word in French.

Suggestions should also handle better character apostrophe. When I tap ""cest"", suggestions should show me ""c'est"" in first choice (or even in second or third), but at the moment ""c'est"" is not even shown. I have t manually tap the apostrophe character.

Well just a piece of feedback

The gesture works OK for uppercase toggle, but does not work for lowercase toggle.

How to reproduce the bug.

The keyboard is now in lowercase state. I swipe up. Now I'm in UPPERCASE state. That's ok.
 But now I swipe up to shift back to lowercase state. But I still see UPPERCASE letters.

After some testing I found that when I start to swipe up the keyboard really toggles back to lowercase, but when I continue swiping in shifts to UPPERCASE again.

Like hitting 'a' twice gets you an 'á'. However, many times, hitting 'a' + other key + 'a' again gets you 'aá', regardless of the second character.

This way if you type 'mama' fast, you will get 'maá'.

What presumably happens is that when you hit the second 'a' the app senses that not long ago you had hit another 'a', so now it must delete one character and replace it with an 'á'. It doesn't take into account that another key was hit between the two 'a' keys.

This bug has been around for a few years now, and I hate to see that such a nice app cannot be used reliably.

I believe the bug is in the main app, and not in the hungarian addon, however, I report this to both contacts.

1. Install more than one language. Let say English is the first one an, say, Russian the second.

Expected behavior: when switching to numbers layout, the upper right button will be labeled with currently selected language (because pressing it always returns to current language)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,The DV layout reorders what i type limiting maximum speed,[],"Hey.  I love this product and have donated.  I wonder if you could check into this issue i've been having on Dvorak; i can only type so quickly or else the letters will appear (in correct order) and then rearrange to a different (read: wrong) order.  It seems to happen in portrait mode espeically, where keys on the left side, even if tapped later, may be rendered BEFORE keys on the right side.

So i type words like 'captain' and for a brief moment 'captain' is rendered but it changes to 'captnai' or similar.  Its threshold is too low when lots of memory or cycles are being eaten by processes.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Enhancement request: Long press on space bar to select among input methods (e.g. Handwriting),[],"I just installed the new [Google Handwriting Input application.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.handwriting.ime)

It seems to me that:

If the Anysoft keyboard is the active input method that there is no way to get to {switch to the Handwriting input method}.

If Handwriting is the active input method, then a long press on the {space bar} lets me switch to Anysoft.

According to the [Handwriting Input FAQ](https://support.google.com/faqs/faq/6188721?hl=en)

""How can I switch back to handwriting from another input method?
""That may depend on the other input method. Often this behavior is triggered by a globe button or a long-press on e.g. the space bar.""

Will you be updating Anysoft to be able to switch to another input method?

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Shifted characters not working in Thai,[],"I'm trying to develop a Thai keyboard extension for AnySoftKeyboard. There is one floating around on the web, but it does not work well.

Here's my problem: the ""h"" key (for example) should produce the letter ""mai tho"" when unshifted, and ""mai taikhu"" when shifted. So I put this in the xml configuration:

<Key android:codes=""0xe49"" android:keyLabel=""\u0e49""
ask:shiftedCodes=""0xe47"" ask:shiftedKeyLabel=""\u0e47""/>

But: Unicode thinks ""mai tho"" is a ""non-spacing mark"", not a letter, so in AnySoftKeyboard.java, calling isWordSeparator() for this character returns true. This causes onKey() to call handleSeparator() instead of handleCharacter(), and handleSeparator() does not process the the shiftCodes array. The effect is that pressing ""mai taikhu"" in shifted
mode prints ""mai tho"" instead.

Note that Thai does not, in fact, have any word separators: all the words are run together with no spaces.

A partial workaround is to add ""mai tho"" (and a lot of other characters) to additionalIsLetterExceptions. But: these exceptions are only consulted by isWordSeparator() when mPredicting is true. So this workaround works when typing in some places, but not in others.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Auto-capitalization bug in 16key layout,[],"For a few weeks ago I see some bug when using 16 key layout. When I'm writing a new sentence, it automatically ""shifts"" first letter to be a capital. It is ok. But if I write some letter which is not at a first position at desired key, it stays in capitals until I write some letter which is at first position or if i press spacebar.

For example:
I want to Write: ""Hello, my name is Tomas Hrochmut.""
On display is: ""HELLO, my name is Tomas HROCHMut.""

So, if i start sentence or name with capital letter and I do not write one of these letters (A, D, G, J, M, P, T, W, dot, spacebar), it does not switch automatically back to small letters.
It does not matter if I write quickly or slowly. Installed on Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (GT-I8190N).

Could it be the problem is the PackBroadCastReceiver.java ?
It's just this:

``` java

import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;

public class PackBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    }

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,"Suggestions row ""pushes"" up page of current app which causes app's page to be hidden",[],"Reproducing:
1. Have ""Show suggestions"" turned on in ""Special dictionaries"" setting
2. Open Whatsapp, for example but happens in other apps
3. In one of the chats, touch the message box to start typing
4. Start typing and continue typing until ""Suggestions"" row appears (by default should appear after two characters)

Actual:
App's page is pushed up by the ""Suggestions"" row so its top part is hidden a little

Expected:
App's page shouldn't be pushed up but rather its height should be reduced from the bottom.

Reproduced on:
Nexus 5, Lollipop 5.1

Thanks for adding dot to the numbers keypad (very usefull to input IP addresses !), but it'd be even better to be able to input space as well, wich comes in very handy when inputting phone numbers, for instance (e.g. +33 1 23 45 67 89)

Maybe as a pop-up on the dot key ?

That space should however ignore the ""space gets back to the letters keyboard"" option though. Otherwise, it'd be of little value.

Unless I'm mistaken, the way to enable caps lock is to double-tap on the shift key, right (I'm using the french bépo layout) ?

Would it be possible to enable caps lock by long-pressing shift instead (or in addition) ?

What's more, the shift key looks no different whether is has been tapped once (= only the next character will be in upper-case) or twice (= caps lock is on). That's rather confusing at times. Other keyboards either display the up arrow in solid color when tapped, with a different color when caps lock is on, or (better, IMO) display a small horizontal line underneath the arrow when caps lock is on.

Fore example holding `i` will not create `iiiiiiiii` (expected), but `ííííííí` (wrong) instead. To get `ííííííí` i would like to one short tap followed by press and hold, because two short presses create `í`.

However, some letters can have more than one diacritic mark, for example `e` can have `é` or `ě`, and `u` can have `ú` or `ů`. So to get `ů` a tripple tap is required and for `ůůůůůůů` I would expect two short taps plus press and hold the third tap.

I would like to be able to (for example) edit a text file and have this change the geometry of the keyboard layout, for example to make the spacebar comparatively taller than other keys, or to move keys all to one side, or to have more rows than ASK currently allows.  I don't require some graphical editor, but it sure would be cool to be able to edit.

I'd like to change the Dvorak keyboard, already excellent, to suit my preferences even more accurately!

Thanks for making an awesome product.

More info:
CM 7 on rooted Nexus One.
The event happens randomly. I can't make it happen at will.
I use v120.1.2.20131226 with Dvorak/Colemak layout, no additional dictionaries or skins. 
If this is happening and I tap on a letter, then the ""two pieces"" of the keyboard get together again, but still can't type anything

I hope I can fix it because it is the best dvorak keyboard on the market but this is getting more and more annoying. I tried unistalling and reinstalling, rebooting, and some others.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Feature request: abbreviation support,[],"In addition to or as an extension of the existing words table it would be nice to be able to specify abbreviations or substitutions to be made upon hitting the space bar. Some people might use it for shorthand, for example. But actually my interest is for partial on-the-fly reverse transliteration. 

My son is starting to use his phone and a Bluetooth keyboard to take notes in his talmud class. He types much faster in English than in Hebrew, not to mention getting used to the idea of switching the keyboard layout back and forth -- although ASK makes it fairly easy, it still would slow him down to switch back and forth regularly to enter a few Hebrew words here and there in his mostly English notes. So it would be nice if he could configure ASK to insert ""גמרא"" when he types ""gemara"", ""רש""י"" when he types ""rashi"", etc.

If the last action was to replace the word with a suggestion from a dictionary then Backspace only undoes the replacement but doesn't delete the last typed whitespace or a punctuation character. To actually delete the last typed character (the whitespace or the punctuation) and return to suggestions mode the Backspace needs to be tapped again.

Thank you.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Key preview position is not always consistent between devices and themes,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","I'm the maintainer of the Hungarian layout and with recent versions I got bug reports, that long presses on some buttons result in an incorrect behavior. As it turns out key 'U' for example is on the 4th column from the right and moreover the Hungarian layout provides a 4 key popup window for this key (uűüú). The default letter for the long press is actually the letter in the popup appearing right above the U key. Now the problem is that the popup is sometimes right aligned, but sometimes left aligned so I cannot create a layout that is consistent on each devices. On some devices with high resolution the popup is aligned on the right while on lower res devices on the right. You can see the same effect on the same device using default and a glow dark theme. (it seems that the padding of popup in glow dark is smaller resulting in a different layout).

This issue was probably introduced because of added padding in the popup layout. (which is fine, but should be made consistent)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Performance improvement suggestion,[],"Dear developers,

I am a fan of AnySoftKeyboard, and recently I am writing a static code analysis tool to conduct performance analysis for Android apps. I found several violations of ""view holder"" patterns in AnySoftKeyboard's code. These violations could affect the ListView scrolling performance.

Currently in AnySoftKeyboard, in some list/array adapters the getView() method works like this

public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
  View item = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.listItem, null);
  ((TextView) item.findViewById(R.id.text)).setText(DATA[position]);
  ((ImageView) item.findViewById(R.id.icon)).setImageBitmap(position & 1) == 1 ? mIcon1 : mIcon2);

  return item;
}

When the users scroll a list view, this method is going to build new views continuously instead of using the recycled ""convertView"". This wastes a lot of CPU cycles in ""view inflation"" and RAM in storing view objects. On low end devices, GC will kick in frequently because of RAM pressure. This will reduce the UI smoothness when a list has many items (even a list only has a few items, continuously building new views during scrolling is a waste of computational resource).

Google suggested a faster way for getView(), it works like this:

We define a ViewHolder class with two fields: TextView text and ImageView icon. Then the getView() can be implemented like this:

public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
  ViewHolder holder;
  if(convertView == null){
    //we have no recycled views to use, then build new one
    convertView = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.listItem, null);
    holder = new ViewHolder();
    holder.text = (TextView) convertView.getViewById(R.id.text);
    holder.icon = (ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.icon);
    convertView.setTag(holder)
  } else {
    //use the recycled view to improve performance
    holder = (ViewHolder) convertView.getTag(); 
  }
  holder.text.setText(DATA[position]);
  holder.icon.setImageBitmap(position & 1) == 1 ? mIcon1 : mIcon2;

  return convertView;
}

I noticed that in the following adapters, the view holder pattern is not correctly implemented:

com/anysoftkeyboard/ui/settings/AddOnListPreference.java
com/anysoftkeyboard/ui/settings/UserDictionaryEditorActivity.java

Looking forward to your response and hope I can help improve AnySoftKeyboard :)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Autotext Improvements and patricia tries adition,[],"Hello, Not sure where to start..

This  is first commit about language related improvements. I love the customization options this keyboard provides, but the language features had some limitations, I would like to work into this, because I wish to have a great word dictionary/prediction/suggestion/etc.

This commit, improves AutoText feature, and there is room for more.
- Custom tries where replaced with https://code.google.com/p/concurrent-trees/ , because the previous version was having some size limitations, and also was missing some words, concurrent-trees is a robust solution, full featured.
- Generated trees are cached to disk in serialized forms (if available) /data/AnySoftKeyboard/AutoText ( example /data/AnySoftKeyboard/AutoText/en.serialized )
- Trees are generated in background, and will become available when these are processed.

TODO:
- when the application/service loads (starts), it should load to memory the most used generated trees.
- tree generation and serialization should be performed on add-on installation and not the first time you load open the keyboard/switch dictionaries.
- there is a need to remove/clean, serialized versions when some new _addon_ is installed.

Improvements over previous version:
- better and robust handling of words in trees
- no size limits
- faster loading and switching (specially with big auto-text files)
- tree caching

I still need to investigate how the other parts related to language works..

"
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,"Blank ""Key preview"" for some keys ",[],"Currently, the ""Key preview"", of some characters are just ""blank"". Not sure if I'm doing something wrong.

For example arrows ↑  and ↓ correctly show ↑  and ↓ as ""key preview"", respectively, when long-pressed and repeatable = true, like this:

```
<Key android:keyHeight=""@integer/key_short_height"" android:keyWidth=""12.5%p"" ask:isFunctional=""true"" android:codes=""@integer/key_code_arrow_up"" android:isRepeatable=""true"" android:keyEdgeFlags=""left"" ask:hintLabel="" "" android:popupCharacters=""""/>
        <Key android:keyHeight=""@integer/key_short_height"" android:keyWidth=""12.5%p"" ask:isFunctional=""true"" android:codes=""@integer/key_code_arrow_down"" android:isRepeatable=""true"" android:popupCharacters="""" ask:hintLabel="" ""/>
```

but with the same configuration, with keys  ← and →, it shows a completely black ""key preview"". Sometimes, the ""key preview"" shows correct for some ms, but these get black quickly.

```
<Key android:keyHeight=""@integer/key_short_height"" android:keyWidth=""12.5%p"" ask:isFunctional=""true"" android:codes=""@integer/key_code_arrow_left"" android:isRepeatable=""true"" android:popupCharacters="""" ask:hintLabel="" ""/>

```

Something similar happens with some other keys, such "",.?!"", when you hit these quickly. ( I have some vague suspicious that this happens, when a hit of these keys cause a change of caps(visual change caps in all the keyboard), for example, moving the cursor(with right and left arrows) inside this text: "" . . . . . . . . . "")
"
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Back-word feature should remove some previous whitespace and room for improvements.,[],"I'm currently creating a custom layout for my language, and the key ""delete"" defaults to delete ""backword"" (because I prefer this way). like this:

```
<Key android:codes=""-7"" android:isRepeatable=""true"" android:keyEdgeFlags=""right"" ask:hintLabel="" "" android:popupCharacters="""" android:keyIcon=""@drawable/sym_keyboard_delete""  android:keyWidth=""15%p""  ask:isFunctional=""true""/>
```

I think this function(delete back-word) can be improved to provide what it seems a useful  behaviour. Currently it seems, it only delete the previous word, and non-words are deleted char by char.

Suggestions:

**1.**
When the previous characters are just ""whitepspace"" remove all the whitespaces till the first non-whitespace char.

For example this: 

```
and some words.    |
```

 will become this:

`and some words.|`

**1.1** 
An exception when there is newline characters:

```
and something.
        |
```

will become

```
and something.
|
```

**2** 
First hit to delete ""back-word"" should remove just the previous char. _this allow corrections of the last typed char(when we notice we made an spelling)_. Next hits should remove whole words.
For example:

```
and I made a typi|
```

will become 

```
and I made a typ|
```

then, if I hit delete again(or If I keep pressed the ""delete"" key), should become:

```
and I made a |
```

**3** 

A timeout, to allow _char by char_ deletion. similar to previous suggestion, if I hit ""delete backword"", then wait a little bit (good idea to have it configurable via preferences, such 120ms), the next hit to ""delete backword"" will delete just 1 char.

For example:

```
and some text|
```

will become

```
and some tex|
```

wait 190ms, hit again ""delete backword"" will become

```
and some te|
```

etc..

I run out of imagination with this function.. for now :)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Do not auto-popup on-screen keyboard if usb/bluetooth keyboard is connected,[],"On-screen keyboard pops up each time text-editable element is focused, but when hardware keyboard is open or usb/bluetooth keyboard is connected, it annoys hell out of me (I think most users will agree). Yes when I press a key on hardware keyboard ASK on-screen keyboard does go away due to the tweak available in Settings, but why should it pop up at all? Okay there are uses for that, I imagine, let it be the default option, but at least give users an option to disable on-screen keyboard at all when hardware kb is present.
"
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Add option to change layout-switch shortcut,[],"Many people use bluetooth keyboards with their android devices (as do I). Some of us need more than one layout and ASK is the best keyboard for this (in my opinion at least). Current shortcut (shift+space) to change layout is counterintuitive for any person used to hardware keyboards. Can you please add the option to select another shortcut (preferably customizable) e.g. on my PC I use Shift+CapsLock (which also isn't a standard, I know), but at least addition of Ctrl+Shift and Alt+Shift options is a must.

- top row button captions
- suggestions (the worst issue of them all)
- Home and End buttons on the utility keyboard
- button to switch to additional symbols keyboards
- all text based smileys (in long press menu)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Some questions about building dictionaries,[],"As you may know, f-droid.org distributes this app which it builds from source. We don't build language packs but recommend people to build themselves or download via code.google.com. Now the script for creating dictionaries is only in the source code there. It's only visible by direct link and requires the xml dictionary to be in dict and not in e.g. en/. I can't find it in AnySoftKeyboard-Tools on github.com: is there a reason for this? Anyway I have built something called res/raw/words_1.dict which I assume is OK. 

Also, is it ok to delete keyboard_keystore? 
"
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Show unicode characters by default for arrows keys instead of icons,[],"Previous versions of ASK used Unicode arrow characters for arrow keys by default. I think they're much more cute than current gingerbread-like rounded icons. And the main problem is that now no theme can return to the old look and use characters again, because the code takes that icons as a default!
The issue was previously here: http://code.google.com/p/softkeyboard/issues/detail?id=984
Now I've rebased it against your new version.
Also it changes fallbackIconSetStyleId from fallbackTheme.getIconsThemeResId() (which is the default theme id) to just hardcoded R.style.AnyKeyboardBaseKeyIconTheme.
I assume it's more correct because in theory any theme may be selected as default, and for example if you'll select gingerbread one, with previous code you'll again lose the ability to return back to unicode arrows.

So please review and merge this change! :-)

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Release 79,[],
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Keyboard switches back to QWERTY Latin in Firefox address bar,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","From Mozilla bug 802975 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=802975),
1. Enable the ""QWERTY Latin keyboard"" and another keyboard (e.g. Hebrew keyboard)
2. Open the Firefox address bar
3. Switch to Hebrew keyboard
4. Enter a Hebrew character

The keyboard is switched back to QWERTY Latin keyboard.

This occurs because after entering the first character, Firefox calls InputMethodManager.restartInput() to change the keyboard action from ""go"" to ""search"". However,  AnySoftKeyboard switches back to QWERTY when restarting. This does not happen with the Android keyboard. This also seems to not happen when the ""QWERTY Latin keyboard"" is disabled. Thanks for looking into the issue!

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,open,Word Suggestion for Devanagari.,[],"I think I have seen somewhere that the word suggestion doesent work after the use of symbols but this is problem for Devanagari Languages like Nepali, Hindi etc.  because the symbols (we call it Matra) are part of the word in those language. I have made a devanagari keyboard layout and a Nepali Dictionary based on AnySoftKeyboard but the suggestion doesnt work because we use devanagari symbols and the word suggestion doesnt after that. I hope you can understand the problem and provide option to break or restart word suggestion only after space key.

AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed, New BETA v77,[],
AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard,closed,Russian key layout which uses long-press,[],"I've made a Russian key layout for AnySoftKeyboard, where keys are not so tightly packed as in the default layout, less used keys are invoked with long-press. The 27-key layout has the same button size as the English key layout, and the 25-key layout is for budget phones with tiny screens, which are quite popular where I live.
It would be nice to merge this thing into the Russian language pack, however it's not inside Git - I've found it at the old SVN:
http://code.google.com/p/softkeyboard/source/browse/trunk/LanguagePacks/
but it's kind of outdated.
So I've modified the LanguagePack project from Git:
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys

The APK file to test, it does not contain a dictionary:
https://github.com/downloads/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/ASK_Russian_bigkeys.apk

If you'll be merging it into the old language pack, you only need to copy these files:
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/blob/Russian-bigkeys/res/xml/keyboards.xml
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/blob/Russian-bigkeys/res/xml/russian25.xml
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/blob/Russian-bigkeys/res/xml/russian27.xml
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/blob/Russian-bigkeys/res/values/strings.xml
https://github.com/pelya/AnySoftKeyboard-LanguagePack-Russian-bigkeys/blob/Russian-bigkeys/res/values-ru/strings.xml
If that's too bothersome to you, I'll just release my own apk file to the Android Market/Google Play.
