y20k/transistor,closed,Save multiple streams as a single station,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted"")]","Some stations publish lists of their streams as M3U playlists. Oftentimes streams on the lists have the same content at different bitrate. Sometimes URLs on the lists change in time and/or ""space"". For example to connect users to the closest transmitting server. This is how things might work

1. A user inputs playlist URL when adding a station.
1. Transistor downloads the playlist, saves a list of stream URL-s **and** the playlist URL as a single station.
1. The user chooses a stream to play.
1. The stream is marked as default.
1. Next time user tunes in the station, the default stream is played.
1. The user can choose to play a different stream from the list.
1. The user can reload the playlist to get an up to date list of streams. If the default stream is not present on the new list, the user is required to choose a stream again.

Having the same station at different bitrates for different situations (e.g. mobile connectivity vs wifi) as a single item on the list of stations seems more convenient than having two separate stations."

I'm afraid that I don't really know what I'm doing / my way around Java, so there's probably dumb things that needs to be looked at.  For example, I'm switching to a `TreeMap` instead of a `LinkedHashMap` so I can actually iterate from one element to the next; but that changes the sort order so it's no longer the order they were created in.

To test: install [android-media-controller](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-media-controller) and use that to control transistor.  While there _is_ a [desktop head unit](https://developer.android.com/training/auto/testing/) for Android Auto, I couldn't figure out how to make that emulate previous/next buttons.

y20k/transistor,closed,"Writing to external storage seems to fail, app handles this poorly","[Label(name=""bug"")]","Underlying issue:
- The app has storage permissions enabled.
- /sdcard1/Android/org.y20k.transistor/files/Collection/ is created. 
- Adding a new station works, either by opening the stream file from a file browser, by opening it from the browser, or by manually inputting the url. That is, a stream is added to the list and can be played. However, no file is created under the /files/Collection/ directory.

I believe this is due to a bug in my device: https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/bug_tracker/issues/125 and that's obviously not Transistor's fault. However I'm opening this bug report due to Transistor's handling of this error:

1. Adding a new stream works. As mentioned, no file is created on the sdcard. The user is not informed that a file was not created.
2. Attempting to change a stream's icon launches the gallery. However, after an image is chosen it is not updated and user is not informed that an error occurred. 
3. Exiting the app via back button, or changing to a different app via multitasking, will result in it launching next time with an empty stream list. User is not warned before app is closed.
4. Refreshing the stream lists via pull-to-refresh will cause the entire stream list to be deleted. User is not informed why streams were deleted. I would argue that even if the refresh finds that some stream files have been removed from the SD card, the user should be warned that they'll be removed from the list.


As an aside, the app's minimal interface makes these issues especially frustrating, as there is no way to understand what's going on and why data keeps getting deleted. I thought the app hasn't even implemented saving the state of the stream library until I read the github page.

y20k/transistor,closed,big volume knob (request),[],"___

(you can skip this part)

Some brainstorming on the subject.

Let's say I am listening to radio,  with Transistor on the background, and then choose to  play a video on the Youtube. Transistor will stop, the video will be playing, and the first thing I will have to do is adjust the volume on my phone.

Then, if I want to stop the video and wish to go back to listening to the radio, with Transistor, again, I will have to adjust the volume on my phone.

Possibly, the same might need to be done when switching between radio stations.

We could say that the ""volume problem"" is a common issue on the web media.

Therefore, Transistor should have a volume adjustment (for itself, not for the system).

How would that adjustment look like?
From a practical point of view, it should be  a slider.
But, since this is Transistor, a retro reference might be preferred:
a big volume knob.

----


How big would that knob be?
Simply, while holding your phone with your hands, try to draw a curve or a circle, on the screen, using your thumb, as if you were turning the imaginary knob.

There you have the outline of the ""big volume knob""."

## Test using your phone
If you want to test Auto support on your phone you need to enable **Developer Mode** and **Unknown Sources**

* see: [Testing apps for phone screen](https://developer.android.com/training/auto/testing/index.html#phone) 

## Test using your car
Sorry. I am not sure how to test this in an actual car. You probably need to activate **Unknown Sources** somehow. Because by default Android Auto only runs / displays Apps from the Play Store.

"
y20k/transistor,closed,Switch to ExoPlayer - Beta Testers wanted,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""help wanted""), Label(name=""question"")]","Hi there,

Transistor traditionally has used [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html) as its back-end. MedaPlayer for the most part has worked great for me. But there are some issues with AAC and newer adaptive streaming technologies, as well as sometimes a slow start-up time.

In the past I was very hesitant regarding any experiments with the back-end, since the existing one worked most of the time just fine. I argued that Transistor is basically a one-man-part-time-show, and that I needed to keep development sustainable. Therefore I did (and do) not want to experiment with any third-party media libraries.

Enter [ExoPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer.html). ExoPlayer is an open source media library developed by Google. It is used as the back-end of their YouTube app. ExoPlayer promises better codec compatibility. It is probably pretty future proof, since Google uses it in their own apps. 

So after some thinking/considering I decided to give it a try. The results are pretty good so far. It seems that streams start faster than in the past and Transistor still plays back all of my (23) stations.

Switching the back-end is a pretty big thing. So before I roll out the next version of Transistor, **I need YOU to test the playback functionality** of the app. I need to decide if I should continue to pursue the ExoPlayer route, of if I should go back to MediaPlayer.

So if anyone here has time to spare: Please check out the latest beta release.

The audio playback will stop after a period of about 10 minutes up to an hour, I think. After a period of several minutes (something like 5-30 minutes) playback will often resume. Sometimes this doesn't happen though (or maybe I didn't wait long enough). If it resumes it will keep playing for a period of a few seconds up to 15 minutes, maybe. After this point, I might as well stop Transistor, because playback has become so unstable.

Playback is extremely stable and never stops, when the phone is connected to power. Also the playback is stable and never stops, when I'm actually using the phone (screen on). So the problem only occurs when the phone is lying flat on its back and running on battery. These are the reasons why I think it's related to doze.

I've tried disabling Androids built-in battery optimization for Transistor, but this makes no difference. I read somewhere that you're using Androids audio playback for the stream, so maybe that's why disabling battery optimization for Transistor has no effect.

The main offender here is Youtube - if I click some Youtube link by mistake, Youtube app will stop Transistor, and there is no way to quickly start it again.
Also few games are grabbing audio focus for no reason when starting  (Pokemon Go, Oddworld), this stops playback, but when you start it again from Transistor's main window, the game will not do this anymore.

Expected behavior:

Observed behavior:
Bluetooth receiver's metadata display is stuck showing the last information sent by the old station, and never refreshing to show metadata from the new station. The only way to update it is to manually press stop/play. This can also be avoided by stopping the current station before playing a different one.

Why would anyone tap on a station other than to start playing it? I think what would make the most sense is to just play the station on short tap. 

This would address another issue I believe the app has, which is the current inconvenience of changing stations. It requires too many taps: pressing the back button to return to the list of stations, tapping on another station, then finally pressing the play button. Going through these many button presses and screen changes is pretty difficult to do while driving.

I realize this implementation would raise other questions, such as how to otherwise get to a ""now playing"" UI with stop/resume controls, where to show the metadata etc. My only thought is to otherwise make it like Google Play Music where this information and these controls show in a bottom control bar.

y20k/transistor,closed,Reconnect to the stream...,[],"Hi!

Transistor is a great little app. I like it a lot!

I have a small issue though, which I think would be easy to remedy. 

I tend to listen to Transistor while travelling, and the stream often disconnects at some point in my journey. It would be nice if Transistor automatically tried to reconnect when this happens.

The most annoying instance of this occurs every time I leave my house with Transistor playing. When I get about 50 feet from my house, the wifi signal drops out, and the phone switches to 3G mode. Since the IP address has changed, the stream disconnects. Since it's freezing cold outside, it's pretty irritating to have to take off my gloves, take out my phone, and, with frozen fingers, unlock it, open the app, and press the big play button.

Every... single... time....

today i have noticed that, if I click the ""clear all notification"" button that transistor app / notification closes also. I think this behaviour is not so good. I really like this app. I have deleted TuneIn Radio for your app, because all I need is streaming a radio channel. no more no less. :-) I hope you like my changes. :-)

I change the following:
- notification: add buttons to play, pause and stop stream
- notification: open the app on stream name click
- implement pause functionality
- add new drawables for play, pause and stop
- show some toast to inform the user
- simplify returns in Station.java and StationDownloader.java

When playing a stream and then renaming a station entry, so that the order of station changes, the wrong entry is marked as _playing_.

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a station and rename to _ABC_
- Create a station and rename to _DEF_
- Start playing Station _ABC_
- While playing, rename Station _DEF_ to _AAA_

Then the wrong station is marked as _playing_.

y20k/transistor,closed,update russian translation,[],
y20k/transistor,closed,Fix lint error before releases,[],"A clean checkout of 1.1.6 gives me a lint error:

```
:app:lintVitalRelease/home/krt/src/fdroiddata/build/org.y20k.transistor/app/src/main/res/values-sr/strings.xml:4: Error: The resource string ""app_name"" has been marked as translatable=""false"" [ExtraTranslation]
    <string name=""app_name"">Транзистор</string>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type ""ExtraTranslation"":
   If a string appears in a specific language translation file, but there is
   no corresponding string in the default locale, then this string is probably
   unused. (It's technically possible that your application is only intended
   to run in a specific locale, but it's still a good idea to provide a
   fallback.).

   Note that these strings can lead to crashes if the string is looked up on
   any locale not providing a translation, so it's important to clean them
   up.

1 errors, 0 warnings
```

while I can (and did) forcefully ignore them in gradle's `android` section with

```
lintOptions {
   abortOnError false
}
```

This is a hack. A release should build with out modification. Either fix those issues on your side or (just in case) apply the workaround in your build.gradle :)
