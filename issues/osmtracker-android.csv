nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,open,Feature Requests: Log trackpoint accuracy and GPSImgDirection,[],"I use OSMTracker extensively for surveying work. Two bits of data that would be hugely useful to me are GPS accuracy of tracks (which I guess can be saved in a trackpoint field, similarly to how point accuracy is saved?) and the GPSImgDirection (ie: compass bearing) EXIF tag added to photos or saved in the corresponding GPX file. This would help greatly in visualising track accuracy and also understanding which direction the camera was pointing when a photo was taken.

I've never helped with app development before but I do know the basics of software development so am happy to try and implement this if you can help me figure out where to start!"

nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,open,Tags lost when stopping track,[],"I noticed that when I stop the track (by tapping the disk icon in the top screen action bar), any tags I previously assigned to the track get overwritten by ""osmtracker"". Repro steps as far as I can tell:

- Start new track
- Assign tags to it, e.g. ""holiday,usa,bike"". Confirm them by tapping the SAVE button (disk icon)
- Stop the track
- Resume tracking
- Stop the track

Now long tap the track in the list, select ""details"" and you see the tracks ""holiday,usa,bike"" have been replaced by the default ""osmtracker"" again.

Explanation
------------

The ```dismiss()``` method on ```ProgressDialog`` cannot be called after the associated ```Activity``` object has been paused.  Since there are dismiss methods in the ```doInBackground()``` and ```onPostExecute()``` callbacks it is possible for these to be invoked after the activity has paused but before it has resumed.


Fix
---
To fix this I dismiss the dialog when the activity is paused and then check if it is showing before dismiss is invoked.  Unfortunately the ```isShowing()``` method will return true after the dialog has been hidden through a rotation so the ```dismiss()``` in the ```onPause()``` callback is necessary.

I hope this helps!  Great application by the way."

When a Layout is pressed a description will be displayed in the language of the device (in case the Layout is not in the language of the device it will be given a pop-up with the available languages  for the user to select in which language the  description will be shown), the same window will show the options for download or cancel (the downloaded layout will be in the default language or the selected language by the user).

Also, in the upper right (tool bar), you will have an option to configure the server where you want to download Layouts, if it is invalid an error message will be displayed.

We will be developing this proposal in the [LabExperimental-SIUA repository](https://github.com/LabExperimental-SIUA/osmtracker-android) and then we will make a pull request.   

We have two options for storing Layouts:
- The first option is to create a new ""Layouts"" branch inside the **osmtracker-android** repository or on the **Fork of LabExperimental-SIUA**.
- The second option is to create a completely new repository that the community can manipulate, where the Layouts can be added by means of a Pull Request following the indications of the structure."

No other app adds the words ""for Android"" to the app name.

Go ahead and look in the Launcher. No other app has that added to the
name, making the name overflow in the Launcher. Also on Google Play no
other app adds those words.

And see you are the only Android app with the name OSM Tracker so there
is no conflict,

nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,open,Is upload dependent on export?,[],"I recorded a track yesterday and once home I selected upload.  I checked my GPS traces on OSM this morning and this new track was not listed but in the app it was shown with what I assume to be an uploaded symbol in the track list.
So I selected export and then re-uploaded this track.  I then refreshed my gps tracks list online and it was then visible.
Please correct me if I am wrong but this experience suggests that that upload function is dependent on a previous export.  I am not sure this is what the author intended but without having seen the use cases this is guesswork.

However, as a user, I want to minimise my intereactions with an app so I would prefer to able to upload recorded tracks in one operation.

I assume that the + symbol is the New Track button.  Before going any further please could someone confirm this.  (I have seen apps before where buttons are missing on some platforms).

I also note that:
- if I return to the track list screen and select the + button it Stops a currently recording track before starting a new one.
- however, there does not seem to be an explicit method for stopping or pausing recording.

There may be other ways of resolving this but  I suggest changing the + symbol for a standard Button labelled ""Record New Track"" and that once a recording is in progress, that the label be changed to ""Stop Recording"".

is transferred to a computer for editing purposes.

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Upload_Waypoints

Therefore the OSMtracker documentation should document just what gets uploaded.
1. Trackpoins

4. Photos?
5. Etc.

If the cursor is empty (no rows), it will not be closed as in the code only when moveToFirst() returns true (non-empty cursors), the cursor.close() statement at line 234 will execute.

(2) In the public static File getTrackDirFromDB(ContentResolver cr, long trackId) of DataHelper class at line 341:

When a media button of a connected bluetooth headset device is pressed, the app should start voice recording (for the configured time or until the button is pressed again), preferable using the microphone of the headset. (This seems to work already on a wired headset, but not with bluetooth.)

From efforts made by the authors of osmand I know that this is tricky: Different bluetooth headsets cause different intends in different moments; thus the app must be configurable in a way that allows to switch this feature off (which should be the default) and to select the signals to react to.

The feature itself will be very useful when mapping by car or bike in countries where you are not allowed to touch a smartphone while driving.

I hope you're doing well, because osmtracker appears to be THE gps tracker on f-droid and so I want to implement that distance, as well as the speed.

Before I start coding, I'd like to ask. How should I implement calculating/storing the total length of the currently recording track?
1) don't store it, calculate it from scratch every second by going through all points in the track;
2) store it in the database right next to name of the track;
3) store it in a new field of TrackLogger or something, update that upon adding new points, pull it from there in Track.build for track that's being recorded, recalculate from scratch for all other tracks; 
4) don't care.

I'd prefer option 3, but maybe you have other ideas?

For now, here's a patch to keep updting ""Details"" for the track that's being recorded: I want to add length and speed there, and those should be updated (right now it just makes the number of points update, meaning that it works for me).

When I set a custom path it always stores in the `/sdcard` path (emulated SD card in internal memory) and not on `/sdcard1` which is the external/additional actual SD card.
So if I put a path `/sdcard1/osmtracker` in the settings it acutally stores the data then in `/sdcard/sdcard1/osmtracker`. (took me some time to find my tracked data...)
Is there any way to enable OSMtracker to write on the acutal SD card?
((On my (rooted) smartphone running Android 4.1.2 this is no issue... but this device is not my main tracking device due to age, accuracy and speed.))
Also I think it would be a good thing to be able to set the path by browsing to the desired directory than needing to type in the path. Then OSMtracker maybe should check if it can actually access the desired path.

nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,closed,[issue #261] Run media scanner on all exported files,[],"As discussed, here's the merge request with the code changes I originally proposed. To avoid future uses of the file handling routines suffering from the same bug, I have documented the requirement to perform a media scan after calling one of the methods in question.

On a side note: at first glance, it looked like `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(file, mimeType)` could solve all our problems by scanning a single file without requiring a context – alas, it requires an instance of `MediaScannerConnection`, whose constructor requires – guess what – a `Context`.

nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,open,Support for unlimited audio recording by pressing headset button twice,[],"Added an option to allow for ""unlimited"" audio recording (well, actually it is limited to a maximum of 10 minutes) by pressing the headset button twice: first to start recording, and second to stop recording. I have tested this option with a real headset, but it should also work with the touch-screen audio note button: when pressed, this button shows up a window that prints the number of seconds of recording, and a ""cancel"" button. When pressing this cancel button, recording stops - although I'm not sure whether the audio file is deleted or not, I'll check this also.
Anyway, the default length of 2 seconds is preserved, so that users are not surprised by a change in behaviour. I have also seen when looking at the code that there is still much to do about the ""audio record"" feature: listening to an audio note, deleting an audio file, exporting... I might have a look at all this if you agree, because that's the kind of feature I want to implement anyway for a (future) related project.

There is one hunk in GpsStatusRecord that is not directly related to this: in onGpsStatusChanged, I look at how many of the visible satellites are actually being used in the fix to determine the signal indicator and in addition if this number goes to zero, the buttons are disabled (since location might not be the current one anymore). I don't know if that fits your philosopy. One probably also want's to disable the hardware button functions, when buttons are disabled. However I did not manage to figure out where to do that...

Hope you like this.

  This makes it a little friendlier, and could close out old issue http://code.google.com/p/osmtracker-android/issues/detail?id=135 ""Pinch doesn't allow zoom in/out"".
- For inactive tracks, set initial zoom level and bounds so the track fills the screen
  Otherwise, when you view several old tracks, you need to keep zooming and panning around in order to view each whole track.
- A few javadocs

Also contains 1 small fix for WaypointListAdapter: show times in UTC, not local timezone.

I hope these are useful.

Thank you!

nguillaumin/osmtracker-android,closed,"Need ""no"" locale in addition to ""nb"" and ""nn""",[],"It seems Norwegian language support isn't ideal in Android. There are two written forms of Norwegian, which each have their own ISO code: Norwegian bokmål (nb) and Norwegian Nynorsk (nn). Unfortunately ""Norwegian"" without any for specification also has an ISO code: no.

By law they are equal in Norway, but in practice, bokmål is far more prevalent and in use (80-90 % of written text is probably bokmål).

It seems both no and nb are used in Android: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5153674/android-localization-question

The only practical way to solve this seems to be to have two copies of Norwegian bokmål, one under ""nb"" and one under ""no"". Symbolic links are not supported on FAT filesystems, and thus the app cant be moved to memory cards, string aliases doesn't seem to be practical as one would still need to make the string files containing aliases(?), and I don't know of any way to ""prioritize"" languages (if no ""no"", then use ""nb"").

I've added a readme file to all folders containing nb and no noting that they should be kept in sync.

The ""nb"" Android market text should probably also be copied to ""no"".
