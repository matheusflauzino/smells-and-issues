I see how this behaviour is a cleaner solution than what BBS did before (with the dialog showing every time) but now the json files are no longer usable without (pre)processing them before parsing.

Maybe having an option in settings to select what the export should contain (like a checklist) would be nice? That way the old popup isn't needed but it still gives us some control."
asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,Use static analysis technique to scan wakelock NoSleep Bug?,[],"hmmm, recently I meet with wakelock problems...
After I refer to this two papers, Totally, the paper tells me that:
[
1. http://mesl.ucsd.edu/yuvraj/docs/Vekris_HotPower12_TowardsVerifyingApps.pdf
2. https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/wakelocks-detect-no-sleep-issues-in-android-applications
]
we have two directions to deal with this problem..
1. static analysis(Complete, but introduce more false-positives)

2. dynamic analysis(Partial, but introduce more false-negatives)
(**like BetterBatteryStats**)
Maybe I misundertand this problem..

So If I want to combine these two methods,
Is there a ready-made static analysis tool to detect this problem~?
If yes, where can I get it~?

What I did so far: I cloned this repo, AndroidCommon and ckChangeLog into a common folder (because this repo kept complaining about those folders being missing). However if I do `ant release` in `BetterBatteryStats` in this repo, it complains
```

I struggled with the current ant based build system and was not able to successfully build BBS that way.
However I was able to convert the build to using gradle without too much effort.

Now integrating this into the Fdroid's automated build system poses a few challenges and I'd like to ask your opinion on how to proceed.
1. I can provide grade build files which you can merge additionally to the current system. This would have to be done for both BetterBatteryStats and AndroidCommon.
2. You switch to gradle altogether. I don't know how disruptive that would be for you, but gradle is clearly the more modern and more advanced build system. I can provide a pull request for this too.
3. I work from a personal fork on github where I can adapt the project structure myself. Fdroid builds from that fork but I would have to manually merge every update back into that fork.

I think all three solutions (but probably mostly 1. and 2.) improve how easy it is for people to not only look at the source but download and build it themselves and maybe sent back improvements to you.

I suggest leaving system app as last resort (it is possible that it is not needed at all - I have **not** tested these command lines on all affected Android versions). I suggest invoking these commands as root and **restarting Better Battery Stats process** before offering to install the system app. Process can be restarted by setting up `AlarmManager` alarm and doing `System.exit(0);`.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,"Installing companion system app removes normal app. Impossible to undo, update or uninstall.",[],"This is a real bad one.

When enabling that root companion app thing, the main app exits abruptly. Then, there are two BetterBatteryStats icons in the app list. Starting the first shows a screen, saying that it’s a companion app that does nothing, and indeed it has no menus or anything. The second one just gives me a dialog, saying that it isn’t installed.

FDroid _now_ also shows me there’s an update from 1.0.0.0 to 1.15.0.0 available.

But since it is a system app now, it can neither be uninstalled nor updated (due to supposedly being signed with a different key [WAT?]). Attempting to uninstall it, just results in an error with – of course – no reason given whatsoever.

And since the normal app is “gone”, I can’t undo the move to /system either.

Now what do I do?

This is probably the worst case scenario of a bug, apart from maybe deleting all data. ;)

Edit: For now, I have disabled the app, and will try “Wakelock detector” instead…

When discharging, connect charger when charge level reaches 20% (if not before).

It would be helpful if BBS could generate notifications for these charge/discharge thresholds, to remind me to connect/disconnect the charger. 

I know this is a little outside the scope of the core features of BBS, but it might be popular with the target audience of BBS. If it could be implemented fairly easily, and without increasing the battery usage of BBS, then it might be worth considering. Thanks.

EDIT: As you were asking for free cloud-based translation services, you might want to take a look at http://www.oneskyapp.com/. As far as I know, it's free to use as long you make the translations free for everyone to see.

Crowdin offers its services for free to open source projects. Read about the critera here: https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request

This could be related to the fact that su --context call is performed within another su call, so there are effectively 2 nested shells at that time.
Try to avoid this nesting to see if that makes any difference.
The impact on the UI is not my concern: if the time taken to save a reference is in the magnitude of a minute bbs will need to hold longer wakelocks and this will increase timing problems (two parts of a ref created one minute apart) 

And in longer term, performing all su calls outside the main thread is highly encouraged. That may actually also help with the UI responsiveness.

As an example, Autostarts application - sources at https://github.com/miracle2k/android-autostarts - makes use of both 'su --context' as well as separate threads for all su calls and doesn't have such sluggishness issues.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,2.0B5 - stuck at getting Alarm stats via API,[],"Today I noticed that BBS 2.0B5 keeps obtaining the ""Alarms"" stats via API regardless of the configuration of the ""Alarms using API"" option.
I tried to launch and exit BBS several times in combination with changes to this option, but alarm stats are still shown the same - those marked with _api_

Deleting the application data would probably help in this case, though I don't want to do it right now (as I'm able to reproduce this easily, I'm able to provide more information if requested).

sqlite says:

```
sqlite> select time_created,ref_name,ref_label from samples order by time_created;
36906|ref_boot|Boot
3389934796|ref_unplugged|Unplugged
3389982064|ref_charged|Charged
3455728601|ref_screen_off|Screen Off
3483678536|ref_current|Current
```

As it turns out, these time_created values, which the app obtains via SystemClock.elapsedRealtime(), do not fit in a signed 32-bit integer.  It is necessary to use getLong() to extract this field from SQLite, as time_elapsed will exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE in about 25 days, and then getInt() will start returning negative numbers.  Negative values of timeCreated will cause (timeCreated > time) to be false for most reasonable values of time (including 0), resulting in much chaos.

The phone on which this problem was seen had not been rebooted in 40 days:

```
$ adb shell uptime
up time: 40 days, 09:30:28, idle time: 26 days, 09:46:03, sleep time: 26 days, 16:10:16
```

BTW: I was not successful in making a local build from the current head of tree, as the AndroidCommon repo is missing RootShell.java.  Could you please push your latest changes and make sure the tree is buildable from a ""clean"" checkout?

Thanks.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,[bug] widgets do not update on a fresh installation,[],"This may or may not relate to bug #369

large_widget_default_stat_type and a couple of other preferences used to use numeric values (1, 2, 3, ...) to indicate the time reference (Unplugged, Boot, etc).  This was changed a while back, and migration code was added to update existing users, but on a fresh install the default values are still numeric.  This prevents the widgets from updating properly until the user manually overrides them.

If this happens, ReferenceStore.java:getReferenceByName() will print these errors to logcat:

```
Reference 1 was not found
Reference 3 was not found
```

The quick fix is to just modify preferences.xml; however there is precedent in StatsActivity.java for adding code to repair bad migrations on existing systems.

Proposed fix:

https://github.com/cernekee/BetterBatteryStats/commits/bug-372

Note that this also changes the widget fallback stat to ref_unplugged; this is consistent with the ""fallback fix"" in StatsActivity.java.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,[bug] can't build BetterBatteryStats head of tree,[],"A couple of minor issues were found when attempting to build BetterBatteryStats from the github source trees:

1) AndroidCommon was missing two resource files.  This was remedied by copying them in from the unpacked apk.

2) Commit ca022e131 (Refactored all operations to handle from/to references) made callers to trackStats() pass explicit from/to strings instead of just a stat type.  However, trackStats() was not updated to match the new API.  This was remedied by decompiling the apk, adding the missing function to the source tree, and tweaking the formatting for consistency.

3) In general, it took a bit of work to track down all of the dependencies.  I would propose the following changes:
- Use git submodules to fetch the AndroidCommon library
- Add the LocalePluginLib and ActionBarSherlock libraries into the repo (both are Apache-licensed)
- Add rudimentary build instructions to README

These changes have been implemented here - feel free to pull anything that looks appropriate:

That would mean that the ""su"" call gets stuck and waits forever to get access perms instead of the call being terminated and ended with a permissions denied. If I got you correctly we may have a look into superuser/supersu as this would be very bad: if nothing happens there are no errors but the service creating the reference would stay stuck forever and finally be terminated due to a timeout without me getting the possibility to release the wakelock (maye I will look into the status model of services to see if there is a hook for termination.

If would be great if you could confirm for me to open an issue, tell me what supersu/superuser version you are using and maybe provide a logcat. I will also try to reproduce once you confirm that I got you right (or not if you tell me I am completely wrong).
You got me right, latest su binaries with supersu app.

Answer:
The funny thing is, I updated bbs as user.

The wl appeared. I disabled the root features, wl was gone, some time later I switched the user to the main one (root)

Even I didn't install rc5 with this user, supersu asked for root and the version was up to date... weird?

But, it's a known issue for both su implementations that multi user support is not given yet.

We had the same problem in the past with other people complaining about infinite wakelock from bbs on android prior jelly bean, in that case I assume a dirty root implementation. (Rooted via update.zip in stock recovery).

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,[bug] spinner refresh issues,[],"I think the filter of the ""from"" and ""to"" spinners still need some fine tuning. I found a couple of situations:
- If you select ""Current"" in From, then the To spinner doesn't show any options. Should it be possible to use ""Current"" in From?
- In some refresh situations (at least when setting custom ref and when screen is turned off then on), if the app was left open with Current in From then the To will be populated with all entries, and (at least in my case) it will go to Boot. Current->Boot doesn't make sense, and neither does it for any other To.
- ""From Custom"" seems to be properly filtering the possible To's. It presented me with Current and Screen Off, and after plugging/unplugging I also got Unplugged since it's more recent. Likewise, after doing this having From Unplugged no longer displays To Custom since it's older.

Perhaps you can double check the code that lists the possible values of From so it doesn't list any entry that would have an empty To list.
Also, when something is refreshed (e.g. screen off/on) the From spinner might also need to be changed.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,[bug] slight usability issue when expanding permission descriptions,[],"When clicking on a permission entry (package info screen), it expands and shows the description of the permission.
Clicking again on the same entry collapses it again.

If one of the entries is expanded and I click on another entry, the behavior I'd expect would be that the 1st one would collapse and immediately the one I clicked on would expand.
Instead, touching the screen will always toggle from expanded to collapsed, requiring me to touch again on the new permission I'd like to see the description of which IMO is not the most intuitive behavior.

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,open,[feature] support stats for timespans including a boot,[],"The problem is indeed related to the fact that BBS does passive monitoring and uses snapshots. Each snapshot (reference) describes the stats of the stats at a given point in time, in terms of counters (e.g. alarms), volumes (network) and times (plus combinations).
All those counters are based on userland / kernel counters that do not have any history and are reset at boot.

Now imagine following situation (over simplified):

ref ""since unplugged"": time = 12:00 alarms a1=500 wakeups, deep sleep = 10 minutes

reading at 12:30: time = 12:30 alarms a1=510 wakeups, deep sleep = 11 minutes
-> since unplugged: time=00:30, alarms a1=10, deep sleep = 1 minute

I guess you get the picture.

Now happens a reboot, and all counters are reset to 0. Keeping the previous refs (I could just remove the handling at ""on boot"").

reading at 13:00: time = 13:00 alarms a1=12 wakeups, deep sleep = 1 minutes
-> since unplugged: time=00:30, alarms a1=-488, deep sleep = -9 minute

I guess you get the picture...

What would be needed to support stats with boot in between would be:
1. a ref stored just before the reboot
2. a logic knowing that ""since unplugged"" is not just ""current"" - ""since unplugged"" but ""current"" - ""since boot"" + ""at reboot"" - ""since unplugged""

Pretty tricky heh? Now add that there are many ways to reboot and not all will be proccessed by ACTION_SHUTDOWN (e.g. removing the battery) so sometimes there will be a continuity in the stats sometimes not. 

Now that said I am willing to consider that as a feature and think of a logic to implement that continuity but I hope you understand that it's a little more than just commenting out the deletion of the references at boot.

"
asksven/BetterBatteryStats,open,[wiki] tasker wakelock details,[],"Hi Sven,

Pent has given permission to add the following to the wiki regarding the wakelocks associated with Tasker. I think it would be quite handy to have added, as it explains what they are doing, so is useful to understand to eliminate them when debugging the results.

These are the wakelocks:

M (net.dinglisch.android.taskerm.Tasker)
E (net.dinglisch.android.taskerm.Tasker)
Tasker.UserAbsentWakelock (net.dinglisch.android.taskerm.Tasker)

This is the explaination:

Whenever a new event comes in the monitor 'M' has to get a wakelock while it's processing. Whenever a task is running, the execution service 'E' has to get a wakelock while it runs the task. Whenever you have background checks (e.g. location) the 'userabsent' wakelock is needed to keep the check going every time.

Therefore, they occur a lot. If you want tasks to run and events to be processed while the screen is off, there's no avoiding it.  

When the device is not in deep sleep (even if the screen is off), the wakelocks cause _zero_ extra battery drain (as the device is already awake). _Most_ contexts will cause a lot of wakelocks, but zero extra battery drain. 

For example, the Power context: Android will only send the signal when it's not in deep sleep. So although the 'M' wakelocks will accumulate, they are only happening when the device is already on, therefore having zero battery impact.

Basically:

Feature suggestion for future version if its doable in a battery friendly way: would it be possible to show what apps are using location services ? It would be great to have it listed like e.g. the new Network stats, which then shows what apps have used the location services, and by how much.

Its one thing to know what's using GPS, but that's only half the story with regards to battery consumption and location - if its possible to monitor the use of the location service, it would give a nice insight into what's going on in the background, and by whom.

Wake locks relating to a service are converted to deleted_wake_locks if that service goes away.

The common cause is when you disable wifi: then the wifi-related wake locks (like wlan_wake, etc), all get lumped together as deleted_wake_locks.

also add ref to: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=27227201&postcount=5644

asksven/BetterBatteryStats,open,[feature] add doc about l2_hsic,[],"I found out smth else this morning, maybe some others have already found out too. Nevertheless I will share with you first, before confirming my result
1. Go to settings
2. go to Wi-fi
3. press your menu button (lower left capacitive button)
4. press advanced (thats the only choice that pops up)
5. under ""Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep"" -> choose never
6. Restart your phone. 

as before, it was kept as ""always"" and I am thinking it caused the l2_hsic issue that prevents my phone from sleeping. 

As of now, after 30 mins, l2_hsic is only 2m awake. The change might be due to the reboot, I am not sure. I will report back in 2 days. 

Previously, I reseted back to factory setting, it didnt appear before the first charge, so I shld see what happens after the first charge

I've also tried using juice defender to narrow down the app (disabling app for connectivity when slp), but it seems to me its not an app, but rather the settings, or the modem or router or possibly hardware issue

It shldnt be an app because i monitor my data usage, i didnt seem that there is an increasing data usage which suggest that with or without the wakelock the data usage is largely based on my own usage.

So we don't have any insight which part of the system triggers the particular wakelock, an assumption what might be one cause is fast dormancy and scheduled background processes like alarm clock and sync/update activity (market/maps).

I have tested 1.4.0 a bit now and kernel wakelocks times look spot on to me. Time shown matches sleep time in minutes for /proc/wakelocks exactly. I think the ""count"" and ""wake_count"" might be mixed up though. For example, when BBS shows ""(wc/c/ec)177/154/0"" /proc/wakelocks have 177 in ""count"" and 154 in ""wake_count"" so I think BBS should show ""(c/wc/ec)177/154/0"" instead.

"
asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,"[bug] inconsistent behavior when hitting ""back""",[],"I've got a few more oddities, if you don't mind:

1) I understand about not using the ""back"" button if you want to keep the custom reference. If I've been off doing other things and then return to BBS by long-pressing the home key and selecting BBS from the list, it does indeed remember the custom reference. If, however, I go in to the app drawer and click on the BBS icon, or if I have the icon on the home page and click on that, it gives me the ""no custom reference set"" warning.

2) When it gives me the ""no custom reference set"" warning, the display still seems to be based on some kind of reference point, usually further back in time than ""last unplugged"" but not as far back as ""since charged"" (which we know on Froyo is something different anyway).

3) Sometimes the display does not re-draw fully when you come out of the preferences screen. Usually I get the two option bars but no data underneath. This seems to fix itself if I pop in to the help page and back out.

4) I've no clear idea exactly what sequence of actions I had followed before this one occurred, but the other day after running BBS for quite a while and having set a few custom references during that time, I hit the back key to come out. Instead of exiting the app, the dispay re-drew with data based on an older custom reference. I hit the back key again and another set of custom reference data was displayed, based on another, yet older custom reference. I ended up having going back through about six screens of data, each based on successively older custom references, before the application finally exited.

Actually, I could almost see that last one as being a feature, if it could be reliably reproduced...

"
asksven/BetterBatteryStats,closed,[feature] Widget,[],"nobnut
What I am thinking is maybe a widget that is updated only after a minimum period of sleep and then remains static until after the device wakes up from sleep again (minimum sleep period perhaps 30 minutes). This way it will not cause any wake time as it only updates after the device wakes up 

Similar to the BBS main app, the widget could display:
- Top 3 or 5 apps/services causing wakelock since screen off
- In ranked order
- Perhaps the apps could be colour coded if certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g. > 30% of sleep potential prevented is Red... > 20% is Orange... < 20% is Blue)
- The user can perhaps specify the thresholds and colours via the in app menu

Click on the widget and... whatever you want (open BBS/open battery statistics/open Manage Applications etc).

This might be easier for users than going in to the main BBS app to see the 'worst offending apps' and would present an ongoing glimpse into what causes wake on their devices.

I know I would certainly love this feature and would be more than happy to pay for it via the Market, which I fully intend to do even if there is a free version on XDA
