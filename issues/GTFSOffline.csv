I've been trying to get rtd denver's gtfs data to work, but it's not. dunno where to begin to figure out why not, since i'm quite new to android, although my phone is not: this is in a zte n817 running android v4.4.4.x. Hoping a kind programmer might take a look at rtd's data and clue me in whether the fault is theirs, mine or other :)
thanks in advance. rtd's gtfs page is here
