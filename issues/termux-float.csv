termux/termux-float,open,feature request: option to customize transparency?,[],"Hi, I think it would be really useful if you could customize the transparency of the floating widget. 
The easiest way would probably be to ""mis""use the volume-down-button together with some keyboard letter(s) for that (again), I guess. The volume-down button gets already used as CTRL-key; so e.g.: 
CTRL-PLUS to increase transparency and
CTRL-MINUS to decrease transparency. 
Or any other similar key.

You can paste into normal termux by long press. 
Is there any functionality to paste to floating window Termux?
