Note: This option was allowing the button to collapse into the options menu when there was not enough room on the screen for it. Since the icon is rather small, the only concern is the adjacent spinner text becoming too long on thin devices.
I imagine on a thin device, the spinner text will truncate, which should be reasonable and realistically this problem should never arise unless someone is using the Jelly phone. It should just be watched what text ends up in that spinner on the MainActivity"

I just did we do in WifiReceiver and check the connectivity of wifi OR cellular to determine if the client is listening. This may break the concept of ""isListening"" in the app so it may be valuable to rename or create a new method if you feel. I'm not sure what is considered ""listening"".

Additionally, should we be checking the user's preference for wifi-only to determine what ""listening"" is in this method? Right now i just check if wifi or cellular is connected, because technically you CAN start a download on cellular manually if you have wifi only on. Please weigh in on this.

> Coverity Scan is a service by which Coverity provides the results of analysis on open source coding projects to open source code developers that have registered their products with Coverity Scan.
> 
> Coverity, the development testing leader, is the trusted standard for companies that need to protect their brands and bottom lines from software failures. Coverity Scan is powered by Coverity® Quality Advisor. Coverity Quality Advisor surfaces defects identified by the Coverity Static Analysis Verification Engine (Coverity SAVE®) for fast and easy remediation.

> Coverity offers the results of the analysis completed by Coverity Quality Advisor on registered projects at no charge to registered open source developers.
> What is static analysis?
> 
> Static analysis is a set of processes for finding source code defects and vulnerabilities.
> 
> In static analysis, the code under examination is not executed. As a result, test cases and specially designed input datasets are not required. Examination for defects and vulnerabilities is not limited to the lines of code that are run during some number of executions of the code, but can include all lines of code in the codebase.
> 
> Additionally, Coverity's implementation of static analysis can follow all the possible paths of execution through source code (including interprocedurally) and find defects and vulnerabilities caused by the conjunction of statements that are not errors independent of each other.

   Explanation for issues of type ""ExtraTranslation"":
   If a string appears in a specific language translation file, but there is
   no corresponding string in the default locale, then this string is probably
   unused. (It's technically possible that your application is only intended
   to run in a specific locale, but it's still a good idea to provide a
   fallback.).

   Note that these strings can lead to crashes if the string is looked up on
   any locale not providing a translation, so it's important to clean them
   up.

According to torrent guides such as the Vuze wiki:

https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Select_port_for_Vuze

> Vuze needs only one port for the main data transfer functionality. Choose a port from the 49160–65534 range. If you really need to choose a port within the range 1024–49151 make sure you pick an ""unassigned"" port listed at the IANA port list and which is not already in use by some other application in your computer. 

This guide also recommends the same.  http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/optimizing-torrent-speed.htm

> The safest choice is a port in the 49160-65534 range as this will avoid ISP blocks and possible conflicts with other applications.

Please let us get to that port range, and please make the ""random port"" feature lets us get to that port range as well.
