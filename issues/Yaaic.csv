There has been no commit in the past year or so. I do understand

(which is more than 2 years ago) and is marked as broken.

Can we come to a conclusion and tag a release so we can at least
update to the current code? We need a tag, to be sure the version
code is stable andnot reused later.

Thank you! :-)

Use-case: sitting in a channel with a bot that announces the list of players in a game - if I'm in-game, every time the list is announced I'd get an alert from YAAIC.  It would be nice to be able to tell YAAIC to ignore nick highlights from the bot's nick.

Even more powerful would be the ability to use partial patterns, e.g. `*bot`.

pocmo/Yaaic,open,move sending raw lines to a background thread,[],"A potential fix for https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/issues/218 in the simplest way possible, moving things to a background thread at the last moment.

pocmo/Yaaic,open,NetworkOnMainThread exception when attempting to send rawlines while connected to a IRC bouncer,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Contribution"")]","I'm connecting to a [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) bouncer running on a server somewhere to access some irc networks. 

When I try to do anything that ultimately hits [this method](https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/blob/master/pircbot/src/main/java/org/yaaic/protocol/OutputThread.java#L59) (for example, `/nick` or `/join`) nothing happens. 

Debugging a little, an exception is being thrown [here](https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/blob/master/pircbot/src/main/java/org/yaaic/protocol/OutputThread.java#L66). The exception stacktrace thrown is included at the bottom. TL;DR it's a NetworkOnMainThreadException.

When I connect to an irc network directly I do not see that exception and can change nick, join channels etc as you'd normally expect. 

What's the difference between connecting to my bouncer and connecting to an IRC network directly? No clue. It might be latency and that going direct is fast enough that it doesn't trigger the exception (though I kinda doubt this as you'd still expect slower connections to see this issue then). From the debugging information I can see that I am on the main thread in both cases when attempting to write to the buffer.

Whatever the reason networking on the main thread is bad. When I wrap that buffer write in something like this everything works as expected when connecting to the bouncer:

```
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(new Runnable() {
        @Override public void run() {
            bwriter.write(line + ""\r\n"");
            bwriter.flush();   
        }
    });
```

I can submit a fix for this easily enough but I don't want to be naively spinning up threads here there and everywhere. I suspect everything could be put on a background thread a long ways up the line instead of just before writing to the buffer but don't have enough context right now to see where the best place might be. If you have a suggestion I can go about fixing it :) (I will submit a PR soon either way, this bug is really annoying me)

This is also an issue in the version of Yaaic published on the play store.

pocmo/Yaaic,open,RFE: Paste in typing box the author of a message line when tapped.,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Feature"")]","Hi. I would like to request for a UI enhancement.

Nick completion is impossible in some devices because the virtual keyboard doesn't have the appropriate key. The only current way to not manually typing the nick is to tap ""users"", then the user, then ""reply"". That's three taps for a very common user action.

I would like to ask that when the user taps a message, the nick of the author of that message gets pasted as a new word in the typing box. If the typing box is empty, then it should be ""nick: "" with the final colon and space.

Currently, Yaaic pops up the message in a small window but nothing can be done with it (not selecting, not copying) so no functionality would be lost if message tapping is taken over by this. In any case, showing the message could be moved to long-tapping the message.

This way, if I want to reply to a particular line, I just tap it and start writing.

pocmo/Yaaic,closed,Add support for ~ and & as nickname prefixes,[],"First off, I'd like to note that I did not test these patches, as I was unable to install Eclipse and my generated build.xml did not work. Although these patches are untested, I believe them to be safe to merge. However, please merge with caution if you decide to.

These patches should, assuming I understood your code correctly, help Yaaic correctly recognise ~ and & as nickname prefixes. These are not used by most IRC servers, but there are some that use them. I, for example, am a member of an IRC network which uses ~ for the channel creator. Whenever a channel creator disconnects, Yaaic does not recognise this and leaves said user in the nick list, giving a wrong image on who is online and who is not.

If you are looking for a server using these characters, GeekShed seems to be one, and they have their usage documented [here](http://www.geekshed.net/2009/10/nick-prefixes-explained/).

Thank you for your time and I hope this pull request will be useful for you.

and have enabled automatic reconnect on disconnect, the program
just keeps trying and trying and trying to connect. I found no other
way to cancel the process than to kill it. Ideally, I think there should
be a little delay between the reconnects, perhaps a message saying
""reconnecting in 10 seconds..."" and a cancel button.

"
pocmo/Yaaic,open,Some bugs and wanted features in 1.0,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Feature"")]","Hi this is the best mobile irc client. Thank you for bring it to the world.

Bugs:
1. Chinese translation
   some translation is not accurate. e.g. when someone leaves channel, the 'part'
   message is translated wrongly.
2. Some commands are not interpreted as expected

2.1 /names &lt;channame&gt;
in Yaaic, if it is used in a channel window, it always returns the users of
current channel, not the users in &lt;channame&gt;.
/raw names &lt;channame&gt; returns nothing if i'm not in that &lt;channame&gt;.

2.2 /mode
/mode &lt;mynick&gt; returns nothing instead of the modes i'm carrying.
/raw mode &lt;mynick&gt; nothing too.
It seems yaaic ignores numeric 221.
/mode &lt;channel&gt; prompt an error instead of the current modes of that channel.
/raw mode &lt;channel&gt; does work...

2.3 /lusers returns nothing
/raw lusers nothing too.

2.4 /topic &lt;channel&gt; does not return the current topic.
/raw topic &lt;channel&gt; does work...

2.5 /admin returns nothing.
/raw admin too.
1. charset HZ-GB-2312
   if i choose this charset, Yaaic cannot log in to any server.
   The reason is that the NICK command sent to server is prefixed with '~}'.
   AndChat has the same issue so I guess it is some bug in common lib.
2. automatic NickServ identification does not work for irc.mindforge.org
   and irc.opera.com. Maybe it is related to UnrealIRCd.

Features wanted:
1. choosing of UI language
   I'm using Chinese Android but I want english UI of Yaaic...
2. /whois button
3. Auto join channel, auto commands after log in
   These do not work for my favorite Chinese IRC network :(
   However NickServ authentication does work.
   Is it because that NickServ does not speak English?
   The IRC server is heavily modified it does not send numeric 005. Maybe that's the cause.
4. rejoin channels on reconnect
5. to allow non ascii nick in Edit Server dialog
6. /clear command to empty current window
7. /CTCP commands (at least CTCP VERSION)

When i've just checked out and built the most recent yaaic, tried to connect to my znc bouncer, waited for the connection to complete, then disabled wifi yaaic seems to get a disconnect (and notifies about it). However it does neither try to reconnect on the (existing and available) Edge/3G connection. Even when turning the WiFi on again (received same IP).

Also, as frequent reconnecting to a (replaying) bouncer can get on ones nerves (consider the scenario where one walks by a wifi one knows, e.g. in university/a friends/etc.), is it possble and would it be a good idea to add some setting like ""stay on most long-lived network (3g/edge) if possible"" - and only attempt reconnects if that connection type isn't available?

pocmo/Yaaic,open,channel windows not being shown when using ZNC bnc on ZTE Blade device,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","When using a znc bouncer YAAIC does not show any channels on my Orange San Francisco mobile phone (aka. ZTE Blade internationally), just the status-window and optionally the window informing about new messages will show up. 
There's no difference between channels which are already handled by the bnc and new ones I try to enter via YAAIC after connecting. 
I end up being in the channels, I get the welcome message in the status window and I can even part them by /part #channelname.
When connecting to the network (Quakenet) without BNC the channels show up fine. 

I verified with two Phones of the same kind. 
I tested by deleting all data of YAAIC in the application management of Android and reentering everything from scratch.

A friend of mine (providing the znc for me) can use YAAIC on his SonyEricsson x10mini pro Phone (ndroid 2.2) with znc just fine. (both using v0.9 of YAAIC)  I can use that znc with the AndChat irc client for android without experiencing this issue.

pocmo/Yaaic,open,Does not follow IRC spec,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","I was using Yaaic with a custom server, planning my port of Yaaic to a different chat system, but in the meantime I figured I'd point out some issues and wonder how you'd handle them....

My custom server follows the spec rather strictly, and only places : before messages if it's needed (if the message has a space in it or starts with a :). This is because of how the sending code works... but your version of pirc is hardcoded to parse up to the "" :"". This is invalid and results in the whole packet being printed in the chat log when a message param isn't prefixed.

This is from pirc, not your code, so I was hesitant to submit a patch. Is there a new version of pirc or something, or how is this handled with bundled packages?

"
pocmo/Yaaic,closed,Keyboard randomly stops working in the EditText,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Backstory:  I am in the process of developing an app and was plagued by this issue of the keyboard not sending keystrokes to the EditText (at certain times).  I started digging for other code to see if there was something wrong with mine and ran into Yaaic since it was open source.  Turns out Yaaic has the same issue too (I've tested on a few different devices with different OS's and could reproduce it) - I also noticed comments about it in the Market. 

It seems to be random...but if you type characters, hit enter, then type characters again and do this more than a few times you may see this bug pop up (at least using virtual keyboard, I don't have hardware keyboard).  In my own app, I could not figure out the underlying cause (it might be in the OS), but I did find a workaround that will avert this bug.

For some reason, Android does not like it when executing any other UI code from within the KeyListener/EditorActionListener/onKey (I tried them all).  My solution was to move all of my previous key listening code inside of a Button listener beside my EditText in a horizontal sub-layout.

On the EditText, I set an inputType flag to textShortMessage, which turned that enter key into a smiley key (this way I didn't have any useless keys on the virtual keyboard).  And then just used my new Button as a ""Send"" key.

Just throwing the idea out there as a workaround.

pocmo/Yaaic,closed,Nick completion should ignore mode characters,"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","Currently the nick completion code appears to include the @, +, % or whichever else mode characters the ircd uses.

It seems reasonable to me that these characters should be discarded for purposes of nick completion.

pocmo/Yaaic,closed,Channel windows not created (irssi-proxy),"[Label(name=""Bug"")]","In a number of scenarios, channel windows don't seem to get created when I connect through irssi-proxy. Irssi-proxy acts as a plugin to irssi (an irc client), that presents the state of the irssi session as an IRC Server (sort of like a bouncer, but built into my ""everyday"" irc client).
1. On connect, channel windows for the channels I am already joined to are not created.
2. If I do a join from yaaic, a channel window is not created.
3. If I do a join from irssi, while yaaic is connected, a channel window is not created.

I tried connecting to irssi-proxy with telnet, to see what a client would see. The transcript is below (scrubbed). You'll notice that the nick gets changed (to whatever the nick is in irssi, regardless what the connecting client requests), and the server sends joins for a channel (or more).

pocmo/Yaaic,closed,Nickcolor,"[Label(name=""Feature"")]","Hi,

I have added nick colorizing option to yaaic.
So far, it computes the color on every message using a simple hash method...

Maybe some kind of hash table could be used, but it could potentially take a significant amount of memory on busy channels, not sure yet what will be the best.

Anyhow, this is a prototype that highlight the different users in a room. 

what do you think about it?
Tks,

pocmo/Yaaic,open,Wait for authentication before automatic channel joins,"[Label(name=""Bug""), Label(name=""Feature"")]","There may be other cases where waiting before auto-joining channels would be desirable. But in particular freenode requires me to authenticate with channel services before joining. For this purpose I add to my freenode server config on yaaic:

/msg NickServ identify ********

However there is a delay between sending this message and freenode deciding I am authenticated that prevents me successfully auto-joining channels.

A small delay before auto-joining channels would probably resolve this, but a more robust way would be to wait for a response from chanserv or more service agnostically to continously retry failed channel joins until some expiry or success. The latter approach seems to be what chatzilla does.

Also since this is the inaugural bug, well done on yaaic, it does a lot right and it's nice to see a new project being run so well from the start with github, the site, and the nice logo.
