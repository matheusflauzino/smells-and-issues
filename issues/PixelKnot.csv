It would be good to have that capability."

guardianproject/PixelKnot,open,Application crashes when encryption starts. ,[],"I imported the project into Android Studio.

Edited the configuration. Added android application with 'app'  as module from the 3 (actionbarsherlock, F5android, and app).

Got it running on my OnePlus One. After choosing image and setting phrase and password, when the encryption starts, the App crashes. Im guessing this has to do with the F5 JNI code not running properly. 

I did not do "" Build the F5Android JNI library with ndk-build -C external/F5Android/ "", as I could not figure how to go about it with Android Studio. Ive read that I need to use gradle wrapper and convert project to use gradle.

I appreciate very much the idea behind this application. I think it can be very handful in many different ways. Nevertheless it does not work  as promised: 1) when an image is oppened using the app and we click on decrypt the application crashes; 2) the application doesn't decrypt anything encrypted with a password  (we only have the choice to use the option it shows - leaving in blank the password field...). 

Is there anyway to overcome this issue?

That said, PK is taking several minutes in my generic 7-inch two core tablet 1 GB ram once the picture is captured with the internal camera. I tried in Moto G and is slightly quicker (better CPU I guess) so I'm wondering if there's a way to reduce overall time for processing the image and embed the secret message.

Is this a possible solution? https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/1180
If so, could you please provide more information about the scope, intent and status of the task? I might be able to collaborate somehow.

Thanks.

★ MATHEMATICALLY SECURE: We use the newly developed steganography algorithm F5 which implements matrix encoding to improve the efficiency of embedding and employs permutative straddling to uniformly spread out the changes over the whole steganogram.
★ ATTACK RESISTANT: We’ve launched attacks on images with messages hidden in them using a specialized version of stegdetect, an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images. In most cases, the pictures have been impervious to attack. We will be including detection in an upcoming version of the application so you can easily test it yourself!
