The Dir app shows a circle around the folder icon and file icon. In this process, the file icons are cropped. So, when at times, the icon of a file isn't symmetric, it doesn't look as good as the app does :wink:. So, maybe, rather than circle(for file icons only, folder icons look perfect) if Dir used only, say, an underline and left some space between underline and icon(so that there is enough breathing room for icons, well you know that better than me), it might look prettier.

Thanks."
veniosg/Dir,closed,Modifying navigation drawer,[],"Hey George,

I had some suggestions regarding nav. drawer-

>Increasing height of cover (background image) in navigation drawer

I think (pretty personal opinion), maybe the navigation drawer would look even better if the cover image for `Bookmark` text was a bit more in height, the way it is in Google apps. I think it's more cozy that way.

>Appearance of bookmarks

The bookmarks in nav. drawer appear the same way folders appear in app. Maybe, assigning a different icon for bookmarks and having them appear the same way as different fragments (Settings, About) would make nav. drawer look more consistent.

>Material style icon for New(Plus) and Edit(Pencil)

I think, Dir would look even better, if it had the floating circular icon, as in Gmail for compose, for New and Edit(when selected). The same New(Plus) icon may convert into Edit(Pencil) icon on selecting a file or folder. 

>Adding an option to create a file alongside the option to create folder

As of now, we are able to create new folder with the new folder icon. I think (taking into consideration  above suggestion) adding facility to create new file after tapping the plus icon may add an extra feature.
Many apps have the floating icon, which shows options(which appear as circles above the tapped icon which turns into cross, well you get the point :wink:) when tapped. Maybe the plus icon could be like that.

I'm referencing issue #45 as it is related to this issue.

I tried the app, and it's awesome. I was wondering if it may be better to use a background rather than the cyan-blue color, in the navigation drawer. We may see any Google made app for an example, say Google Plus.

I understand that it might play a role in increasing app size for no reason, but still I thought to let you know. Even if there may be a case where we used colorful pattern rather than cyan-blue, it might look better
