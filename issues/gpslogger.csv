mendhak/gpslogger,open,Feature Request: Visible Wifi SSID List,[],"What:
Sends and logs a list of Wifi SSIDs, MAC addresses, along with signal strength when getting GPS location if Wifi is turned on. This feature should be able to be toggled off too. This should only record public broadcast beacons and not log hidden SSIDs.

Why:
GPS can fail when inside larger buildings or underground. There are some APIs (mainly provided by Google) that will allow you to trilaterate your location based off visible wifi SSIDs and signal strength.

How:
The list could be attached to a JSON object, such as:
```
{
  ...otherJsonData,
  ""wifiSignals"": [
    {
      ""SSID"": ""MY SSID"",
      ""MAC"": ""12:34:45:67:89:01"",
      ""RSSI: ""-98db""
    },
    {
      ""SSID"": ""MY OTHER SSID"",
      ""MAC"": ""01:98:76:54:32:21"",
      ""RSSI: ""-50db""
    }
  ]
}
```
Or in CSV, the fields can be seperated with a `:` and `;`:
`..., ""WIFI:MY SSID;MAC:12\:34\:45\:67\:89\:01;RSSI:-98db"", ""WIFI:MY OTHER SSID;MAC:01\:98\:76\:54\:32\:21;RSSI:-50db""`

The CSV method could also be used for spreadsheet entries."

I'm going to use GPS Logger to track a long motorcycle trip. I won't always have a data connection. Even when I do, it might be really bad. I don't need the location to be updated in real-time; once a day would be just fine.

Would it be possible to send locations in batches by HTTP, like for FTP uploads? For instance, would one HTTP request per track be possible? It would allow me to have a very lightweight server, instead of an FTP server with a cronjob that monitors the upload directory.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,customurl: improve SSL certificate verification step,"[Label(name=""discuss"")]","Hi there,

Partially related to https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/issues/627 - I use gpslogger against an https server with a Let's Encrypt certificate (which is renewed every 3 months). The issue is that, even if the certificate as well as its CA chain are trusted (and the hostname matches the SAN), I need to manually include it in some verified list of certificates by executing the HTTP test, otherwise the app never executes the HTTP GET request. I realized this by pure chance because gpslogger suddenly stopped working, and re-executing the HTTP test (and accepting the new certificate) it started to work again.

Any chance that the SSL verification step can simply go ahead for new certificates when their CA is already trusted?

* after X seconds, it would log the point to storage.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Question: Interested in a new 'sender'?,[],"Hi,

first of all I just forked your project and got it to run. I like it very much. Thank you for providing it.

I am currently working on an end-to-end encrypted GPS tracking service. This service aims to provide the user with the ability to store all GPS data on this service by still protecting their privacy (because it was encrypted on the device and the server does not know anything about the data and key). The code for the service will be open-sourced and anyone who wants to self-host it, is able to do this.

At the moment I have written the server, the web interface and a client based on python (which can be run on a Raspberry Pi for example). Now I wanted to write an Android App that tracks the GPS data and sends it to the server. And I thought why should I start from scratch when someone else did already an amazing job in writing the GPS tracking part? So I found your app and it fits perfectly. So, I was wondering if you are interested in a new sender in your app? I would write the code and would make a pull request afterwards. Is this fine by you and are you interested?

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Battery level,[],"Hi

Great tool, and additionally open source - hats off!

I have a feature request: It would be nice, if there could be added an option to log the battery level of the device too. As of API 21 this should be easily possible with

```
BatteryManager bm = (BatteryManager)getSystemService(BATTERY_SERVICE);
int batLevel = `bm.getIntProperty(BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_CAPACITY);
```

In GPX 1.0 for example, you could add this information as extensions.

Sometimes it is crucial to know the battery level of a device. If for example you are using the device for logging the positions of animals, then it would be good to know, when you need to catch the animal to recharge the device."
mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Adaptive Logging Intervals,[],"I used gpslog last week and would like to suggest what would be a big improvement.

By monioring cellphone handoffs and recent gps readings it should be easy to get a reasonable etimate of speed and distance since the last-logged position. Given that, why not allow logging to be determined on a basis of distance moved or perhaps on speed?

And of course every stop location hould be logged. I noticed in examining a log that where I stopped for lunch was not logged!  That should not happen and in fact when motion stops there should be two log entries, one when motion stops and again when motion starts again (or when logging is stopped)."
mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Issues with Huawei 9 and Android 8,[],"To be fair, I have had problems with other apps since my Huawei 9 auto-upgraded to Android O earlier in the week, such as background apps being frozen by aggressive battery management. This management appears to be Huaweis own ""Phone Manager"" or ""EMUI"" apps, both also upgraded to v.8 along with Android, and they ignore Android's own battery management system...

It's very frustrating when trying to listen to an audiobook and it keeps pausing every 9 minutes. Unlocking the phone shows that app's widget still shows it playing, but until it's brought to the foreground it stays silent. That suggest a kernel-level freeze of apps to me, rather than an forced shutdown.

Anyway - since the upgrade, files don't seem to be created by GPSLogger any more. Whenever I open GPSLogger, it shows the normal ""Stop logging"" button showing all is okay.

Also, the auto-upload (which has always worked okay before) no longer works.

No indication as to *what* is causing it. The crashing code is outside the application itself, somewhere in Android's own internals.  It's not limited to any Android versions or any specific phones. 

Going to leave this here for a while, really unsure how to proceed though.  A search reveals somewhat similar situations in other issue threads/SO posts, but no solution.

Now came back to it and have the upgrade that has additional options under Custom URL specifically HTTP Body, HTTP Headers, and HTTP Method.  Most likely due an issue with my receiving server, but I am no longer receiving data from app.  So I am wondering if you could tell me what these parameters were before they were added as options to change? I.e. has the HTTP Method always been GET?  Has the HTTP Body always been lat=%LAT&lon=%LON?  What was the original HTTP Header and what are options here?
Also, my working URL before was http://domain.name.com:port/...../?lat=%LAT&lon=%LON
Now I see example using http://domain.name.com:port/...../log?lat=%LAT&lon=%LON

maybe I am too stupid and this is already possible to configure, but I did not manage to find out how.

I am using microG and the NLP Backend with Mozillas Database of WiFi and Cellular Towers. This allows me a relatively usable position tracking without kicking up the engery hungry GPS. I have GPS-Logger running in the background to trace my personal movement every day.

The thing is: If I specify a precision filter and a timeout, GPS-Logger will try to get a position accurate enough within that timeout. If not, it discards the point.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,.GPX file malformed; has multiple <?xml> and <gpx> elements,[],"I keep GPSLogger on 24 hrs per day every day. I use it to track my movements for business logging purposes. At the end of each day, GPSLogger automatically uploads the track files to DropBox and I keep them in long-term archive. It works great for this purpose and I really appreciate the program.

The problem I have is that the .GPX files are often malformed; they have multiple \<?xml\> and \<gpx\> elements. I.e., there is a proper leading \<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?\> element followed by a proper \<gpx ...\> element and then a \<trk\>, \<trkseg\> and multiple \<trkpt\> elements. All good so far.

Then, part way into the file, there will be terminating elements \</trkseg\>, \</trk\>, \</gpx\> followed (improperly) immediately by another \<?xml ...\> element then a \<gpx ...\> element then another \<trk\> and \<trkseg\> and so-on. Essentially the second \<?xml\> and \<gpx\> elements create the contents of a second entire .GPX file, but it is present within an already existing .GPX file. This can happen multiple times, ending up with 2 or 3 or more file contents within a single file.

The .GPX files are unreadable by Garmin MapSource - I must manually edit the files to remove the extra elements so that there is just a single \<?xml\> and \<gpx\> element.

[20171031.gpx.txt](https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger/files/1435222/20171031.gpx.txt)

I am attaching 2 example files that exhibit this problem. The one for 10/30 has 2 \<gpx\> elements, for 10/31 there are 3 \<gpx\> elements within one file. Note that I have manually edited the files to remove leading and trailing \<trkpt\> elements (where my house is located) but otherwise the files are exactly as written by GPSLogger. Also note that I had to add .TXT suffix so that I would be allowed to attach them here.

Please help to eliminate this problem with the way that GPSLogger writes malformed files. It takes a lot of extra time to work-around this issue and makes the output from the app difficult to use.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Feature request - Accuracy filter options,[],"Hi,

First I want to thank you for this very good gps logging app.

The feature I request here is (I hope) quite simple to implement. It is about accuracy filter:

It would be usefull to have option to not discard any point if it had at least some coordinates informations, even if it does not match the accurarcy limit fixed by user. So the ap will still wait for the time fixed by user (Duration to match accuracy) to reach the accuracy threshold, if it goes under it saves the point as usual, but if not it still keeps the best accuracy found within this duration, whatever the level and the source (gps or network). And of course it also save the accuracy value like for any point. Then later it is easy to filter out all the saved points by accuracy levels and use the levels we need.
So in this case the accuracy filter would be here to incite to find some level of accuracy winthin fixed duration, but without discarding less precise levels if there is no other choice.
The old Backitude app permits this behavior I think. Maybe there is a way to do that already in GPSLogger, if it is the case sorry but I didn't find it.

I currently use gpslogger with ""log to custom url"" via phonetrack [https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc] but I cannot use that option with ulogger as there is no way (as far as I could discern) to specify authentication (user:password) using the ""Log to custom url"" interface.
The Ulogger server has the possibility to select and show a list of tracks, and would combine perfectly with the ""new track every day"" option of GPSlogger, sending %FILENAME as trackid for ulogger and hence saving and sorting the gps data correctly for each day.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,'No log if not moving' lags behind on Android 7,[],"When logging at high resolution - keeping GPS on between fixes and log interval 0 - gives fine results, and a Moto G4 happens to still have decent battery life with this. This is what I use for long hikes, and Strava results like total distance and elevation tend to be accurate only with this kind of settings. To avoid a cluttery track during rest breaks, the 'do not log if not moving' option would be useful, yet appears to lag behind the actual movement for about half a minute. It keeps logging the first half minute being stationary, and starts about half a minute after starting to move. The latter makes the otherwise highly accurate track missing about 30 points.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Timezone offset,[],"While looking at a recorded dataset, I was wondering if it would make sense to add the Timezone Offset somehow.

All the data is in UTC, which is really great, but when shown to the user it should be possible to apply TZO somehow.

When sending the data to a server in a remote country, you have no access at all to this information, unless you get it from the lat/lng and use a webservice to find the corresponding TZO, including DST Offset.

Since this data is already in the device, and there's no sensible way to add this to the file content, ie into a CSV file, I would propose to expose the TZO including DST to the filename generator, via a %TZO value, which gives the TZO incl. DST in minutes.

This one-time generation of the offset is cheap and would make things a lot easier, also if people are traveling and then start operating on the data later at home.

This is a snippet of code I use in another app to get the offset in seconds between utc and local (phone) time, so it's really no big thing to do.

    TimeZone tz = TimeZone.getDefault();
    Calendar cal = GregorianCalendar.getInstance(tz);
    int iOffsetInSeconds = tz.getOffset(cal.getTimeInMillis()) / 1000;

The main issue is that the location of the recording and the location where viewing at displayed data may be in different timezones and/or dst, so when using UTC in the entire data chain it would be the web browser which converts UTC to local, which could be another place than the one where the data got logged.

Additionally, it could also be beneficial to add the timezone name, ie %TZN ""America/Los Angeles"" or code %TZC ""CEST"" for better use with libraries at the backend."

I couldn't find any existing issue about this, so I'm opening this new one.

While I'm totally enthusiastic about the automatically uploading of files through many transport types, the way it currently works is more difficult as it should be. From a user perspective that is, obviously.

For example, I have the ownCloud Android app installed and my Android has a ownCloud account set up. So my first thought was: cool! A way to use ownCloud to automatically upload the files! Without any hassle!

But when I went into the configuration in GPS Logger, I found out I had to specify the ownCloud URL, user, password et cetera et cetera.

To me, this sounds kinda redundant: I already have an account set up to use.

The same for e-mail. I have `K-9 Mail` installed for my emailing. Unfortunately, `K-9 Mail` doesn't add a ""global"" Android account for the e-mail address used in the app. Therefore, that isn't something you could have used anyway. *But*! It does have [third party app integration](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/ThirdPartyApplicationIntegration) through the Intents/Content Providers Android functions. So I guess you could read that as a feature request ;)

In essence, I would like to use this issue as a two-sided feature request:

* Use 'global' Android accounts for automatically uploading files, such as ownCloud or GMail;
* Specifically add support for automatically e-mailing of files through `K-9 Mail`.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed, Fix #544: undesired scrolling in detailed view,[],I've fixed the behaviour described in issue #544 by adding a matching property to the relevant part of the fragments manifest.
mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Annotation and logOnce,[],"I'm starting to undestand the intention of the app, which differs slightly from what I want to use it for.

I want to use it for tracking my bike rides, with the best possible resolution. When the ride is finished, I want to upload the two files which I recorded onto my server. I am recording the csv and kml formats; csv contains a ton of data, perfect for postprocessing with a Python script, for example, and the kml is great for dropping it into Google Earth and eventually for importing it to Google Maps.

MyTracks had this feature of adding a waypoints, which I used to mark certain locations in order to be able to later compute the time differences. I also used joaomgcd's AutoLocation with Tasker to send me an email when a geofence got entered.

So I've been reading the code and now understand how the Annotation works, as well what the ""1"" button means (had no idea what it does until I checked the logOnce() method)

So the ""1"" button logs one single point into the file, or creates a new one if a ""matching one"" does not exist, it only is usable when no logging is active, I don't know what the logic is behind this. If the app is currently not logging, it is clickable and enables logging for that one shot and disables it again. This makes sense when you have the app like a companion where you are not really tracking the path, but just want to gps-log certain events that happen in the day. Which means that they usually would land in that one-file-per-day file. Nice idea. The same goes for annotations, which apparently are ""1""'s with added text, but can also be added while logging is active, which is great, but not really useful if you want to add ""I'm over the bridge now"" while biking at full speed. Here a button logging a ""mark-1"" is more useful.

But I have my problems with annotations: They don't end up in the csv file also not in the nmea (that's ok), and they overwrite the last added annotation in the kml file. Only the gpx file stores all the annotations as they are entered.

So I need to store three files in order to cover all the data. kml in order to quickly view the data in GE, csv for post-processing and gpx for annotations.

Now, the thing is that I'm adding two new buttons to the screen, which will allow me to set waypoints like I was able to do with My Tracks. So this would basically trigger an annotation with a text like ""mark-1"" for the left button and ""mark-2"" for the right button. 

What I want to do now is to store them into the csv and the kml file, so I'll be working on extending the writers for this file. I'm planning to add a new column to the csv file after the ""battery"", which is ""annotation"" and will contain the annotation string ""jsonified"" in quotes (python equivalent would be str('""'+json.dumps(string)+'""')) in order to avoid unicode issues. With kml I guess it should be no issue since it is a more flexible format, so that they can be inserted as placemarks without affecting parseability.

Do you have any thoughts on this? Are annotations the proper way to implement this feature, or should I create something new?

One question about annotations: Do they stack one over the other? For example, if I press the button ""mark-1"" to create such an annotation 3 times in 1 second, will I get three logged annotations, or will all but the last be discarded until a location fix is obtained? I want to log all button presses.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Feature request: Add %START time to Custom URL,"[Label(name=""feature"")]","Hello!

I very like your app! I using it for remote logging and live tracking of my MTB routes. I write data incoming from Custom URL to START_TIME_OF_FIRST_REQUEST.csv file on my private server. I must hold the start time in some shared var to append new coordinates to this file (start time pointing to it). If there is gap of 10 min between requests I clear that var and then next data goes to new file. Also I use trick - ""*"" in annotation to do the same. There is no way (or I did not find it) to tell server that user ends that track.

All it can be simplified. I suggest to add new URL parameter, %START or %START_TIME for example. It must be equal to first request's %TIME all the time transmission lives. Until user press stop and start new track.
And now we have ready mechanism to separate remote tracks without any headache. Just write always to %START.csv and you done!

All this great for logging. Yet it would be very cool to have way to tell server about stop event in separate %STOP (or not %LIVE) for example. It is to end live tracking on map at this moment and place finish flag :3.

Sry if english not well.
Many thanks for your great app!"

But sometimes I let the files be analyzed by somewhat primitive software (Google Earth, for instance), which does not handle the trackpoints without elevation (for instance) data well. I.e. the Google Earth takes the points as if they were at elevation 0.

It would be nice to extend the present set of filters with one which removes that points from the output.

I assume now, but if the trackpoints match precisely the information as it comes from the GPS hardware (meaning the GPS data sometimes lack the elevation), than there might be records which do have the elevation, but lack the positional dilution. It would be nice to have a **separate** filter for such records, too.

After my phone became barely functional, I went and bought a new phone and proceeded to get it set up with my apps and settings.
Thought it would be a good feature to be able to backup/export the configuration of gpslogger, ideally including all user selectable settings in the app (finding the ftp login password I setup for the app years ago took a while)
May seem at little bit over the top but I spent a lot of time over a period of months tweaking my accuracy settings in the app to get the traces I needed and did not think to write them down. Had I lost my phone all this would be gone.
A good way to get the file off the phone would to be to treat it like the log files. Select backup/export settings in the options and choose the method like you do for exporting logs.
An import function would be nice but simply instructions on where to move a manually downloaded settings file to would suffice if it would get them restored.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Perfomance setup and bad route.,[],"Hello! For a long time I use your program and eventually matured a few questions:

1. For a long time trying to pick up the performance parameters for the most accurate recording routes.
Now I have the following settings:

Logging interval - 20 sec.
Distance filter - 100 m.
Accuracy filter - 100 m.
Duration to match accuracy - 20 sec.
Absolute time to GPS fix - 120 sec.
Do not log if i'm not moving - enabled.
The sources used GPS only.

Configured AutoSend OpenGTS data and text file (.csv) on the FTP server.
It should be noted that the performance parameters chosen brute force, almost at random, and do not give the expected result.
See attached screenshot for bad track.
![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25898530/23198633/4f408b6a-f90c-11e6-8f6f-3c0d8d9b821d.png)


I would like to read description of performance settings in complex and how they affect each other.
Are there any plans for writing such a reference?

2. Application is configured to send info to OpenGTS and CSV file (sended via FTP).
Some devices not send info. I think the reason is bad internet connection.
OpenGTS info lost for bad internet period - it is clear, but CSV file has not these points too.

2.1 Are different ways to send data works in parallel? And when one of them fail (OpenGTS) - other (CSV) also not record point
If I use ""log to custom URL"" instead of OpenGTS - will it resolve issue with not recorded point to file?

2.2 If I disable autosend to OpenGTS - will CSV file has points while bad internet time?

3. If your device Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 (sm-t231 Android 4.4.2) setting is ignored ""Do not log if i'm not moving"", the tablet for a long stay in motionless position continues to record and transfer points.
If I understand correctly, this function uses the accelerometer data? Can we somehow fix this problem?

`Environment.isExternalStorageRemovable(context.getExternalFilesDirs(null)[1])` returns true

Option 1 - 
`Files.storageFolder()` can return the removable storage path.  Downside - would require moving any existing `.bks` files, `.properties` files and `debuglog.txt` files, can get tricky.

Option 2 - 
Internal storage remains the place for the various configuration files and properties files.  GPSLogger folder defaults to the external storage instead of `Files.storageFolder`.  Downside - users get confused about logs being in one location but internal files (.properties, .bks, debug log) in another.

Option 3 - 
Just document it - put it in the FAQ, how to change the logging folder.

**Instead**, I would like the icon in the notification bar to be hidden, and for the notification to not show up on the lock screen. However,  I do understand that the notification must remain in the notification pull-down shade.
I **know** it is possible to hide the notification from the lock screen and the notification bar because a similar app that I use, [OwnTracks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owntracks.android&hl=en), does exactly this. They are another open-source location tracking app, and their code is [here](https://github.com/owntracks).

In all screenshots, both OwnTracks and GPSLogger are running, however only the GPSLogger notification shows up on the lock screen and the notification bar. Notice how both notifications must show up in the pull-down shade, since there is no way around that (at least that I know of).

**What's happening**

Beginning March 1, 2017, Google Play will block publishing of any new apps or updates where PreferenceActivity classes may be vulnerable to Fragment Injection. Your published APK version will remain unaffected, however any updates to the app will be blocked unless you address this vulnerability.

**Action required:** Review the affected classes on the Alerts page of your Developer Console. Where possible, set exported=false for the affected PreferenceActivity in your Manifest. This will prevent foreign apps from sending Intents to this class. If the vulnerable PreferenceActivity must be exported, read through the two possibilities below to determine why the class is vulnerable.

1. Incorrect implementation of isValidFragment

If the vulnerable class contains or inherits an implementation of isValidFragment that returns true on all code paths, you'll need to update the class to check for a list of allowable Fragment classes.

For example, if the PreferenceActivity should allow MyFragment classes and no other Fragments, then your code should follow the below logic.

    public boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {
        return MyFragment.class.getName().equals(fragmentName);
    }

2. targetSdkVersion less than 19 and isValidFragment not present

If your app sets its targetSdkVersion to a value less than 19 and the vulnerable class does not contain an implementation of isValidFragment, the vulnerability is inherited from the PreferenceActivity library class.

To fix this, update the targetSdkVersion of your app to 19 or higher. If you cannot update the targetSdkVersion, then implement isValidFragment as described in 1 (above) and check for allowable fragment classes."

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Suggestions,[],"Hi
I have some suggestions for you:
- I think a dark theme would be nice to have, across menus and main interface
- Could you possible do a ""light"" version where you would remove all proprietary libraries used in getting network location, those used when sending data using various services and leave it to a bare minimum?
  Many people I know and myself use this app to log gps data to our own server, so we don't need any of other logging methods, also we don't need network location.
- This light version would have only these features: get gps signal; send data to custom url plus the time between logs, accuracy filter, distance filter, absolute timeout...
- After successfully  removed all proprietary libraries then you could put this ""light"" version on F-Droid

At least think about it ;)
Thanks.

GPS Logger seems to work in all respects except getting these new items.  Using the NMEA screen in Bluetooth GPS, I see  the sentences $GPGGA and $GPGSA with the correct data in them. When using GPS Logger with the tablet's GPS, I do get the parameters except those related to DGPS. I would be glad to help debug, if there is any diagnostic output available. The Log View only shows Filename and Location. I do not have the development environment setup. I realize the problem may well be in the Bluetooth GPS app. I have also tried Bluetooth GPS Provider by mobile-j.de but it didn't seem to work at all.

I think that the DATA CONNECTION is not necessary to get the position of the cellular towers, in fact other programs (for example Google Map) can locate me even without data connection.

But GpsLogger doesn't? Why?
Cany you help me?

So it appears the message : ""Absolute timeout reached, giving up on this point"". 

I'm using ""NETWORK"" mode, because it is enough for me : I just want to have an approximate position log.
The parameters I use are : freq. :120, minimum distance filter:5m; gpx.

I would like to keep the data connection off to save battery.

Thanks very much !!!

Thanks in advance!!

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Feature request: detect if GPS is already in use,"[Label(name=""discuss"")]","I would like to use different settings when the GPS is already turned on by another app like navigation or city guide. Normally I prefer to have GPS tracker enabled at all times with a relatively high time filter like 10-15 minutes with an absolute timeout of 60 seconds, so it doesn't drain my battery too much. But when the GPS is in use anyway, I'd like it to log track points every minute or so.

Perhaps a secondary set of settings would work if there is no way to detect when a GPS fix is available without actively asking for it: I would set my time filter to 1 minute and the absolute timeout to 1-2 seconds.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Show the time with seconds of the last point logged on the detailed view screen,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Firstly thanks for all of the hard work, this is a really awesome application and you keep adding more useful features to it like the profiles that were added recently.

The time of the last location recorded used to be shown on the detailed view screen (e.g. hh:mm:ss), however in one of the recent updates it seems to have been removed. I used to use the time displayed here to synchronise my cameras time with the GPS time. It would be nice to have it on the simple view as well but I can understand that you might not want to clutter that interface.

Explicitly:
1) Start logging using GPS.
2) Wait for a lock and observe the time displayed on the detailed view screen.
3) Set the time on the camera to match the time displayed so that the time was synchronised.

One possible improvement over the previous implementation (for me anyway) would be to have the display so that it was shown as ""hh:mm:ss (x seconds ago)"" and track the number of seconds since the point was captured using the local time. Explicitly hh:mm:ss is the time of the last point taken from the location provider (gps), x seconds = local_time_when_the_last_point_was_taken - local_time_now. I know that this specific feature is tied tightly to the usecase that I have and might not suit others, but I could imagine that a fair few people would want to syncronise the GPS time with other things that they are logging and so might be a useful improvement to help people syncronise the time accurately.

Thanks,

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Time sync | Logging network time and not system time,"[Label(name=""discuss"")]","This is more of a query, than an issue.
Say I am running this app on 2 phones. Also, the system time in one of the phones is off by 5 minutes. I need to make sure that it logs the time correctly, so that I can later sync location of both phones according to time. If the logged time in one phone is always off by 'x' minutes, on post processing I can never know where both phones were at a particular time.
Now, say I have 100 phones with this app, some following the correct time, and some being off by different amounts, is there a way to log network time, instead of system time?

I see that the PlainTextFileLogger class uses the location.getTime() method to get time, instead of using the system time. This however, still returns the same time as the system time, and not network time.

  Hi!!! Thanks for providing this nice gpslogger project.
  GPSlogger is such a best gps app for Android phones development. We really love it~

  Here is one idea. We all loves go mountain climbing. And everyone has a phone with the gps. If it can show all my friends' GPS location in my phone screen, then once there is a friend lost or missed the way it can send his/her current location to others for help... Or some orientation guide for him/ her to approach to the correct path.

  Is it possible for you to add this new feature into the gpslogger project? What's your view on the matter?

I'm afraid I have another task-killer bug for you. Recently I upgraded to Android 6.0 (CM 13) and over night GPSLogger suddenly stops logging, and I have to start it manually again. This happens every night. Looks like it is related to the new Doze mode in 6.0. Here are a few infos:
- Notification is enabled and it stays, but only showing ""GPSLogger is running""
- Location mode is set to ""High Accuracy""
- I've disabled Android 6.0 Battery Optimization by setting the app to ""Not Optimized""
- My device is plugged-in and charging the whole time
- RAM is averaging around 1.5 of 2 GB
- The debug log shows that the logging stops almost exactly 1 hour after I last used my device (every time)

[4] Using the option at prevents use of the ""New file Creation"" option and its not clear when a new file will be created or is that also misleading. It seems to me that when you start logging you work out the filename, if that already exists then you append to it.  In that case it might be best to show sample filenames or show the masks being used.

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Feature request: 2 Timeout values for GPS fix,[],"Hi, 

I'm using a only Android phone running unmanned and fixed in my car with this great software. However, at night the car is in the garage, the phone runs on own battery and so there is no GPS reception, which drains the battery. So one feature would be nice:

There is the ""absolute timeout"" value which aborts the try to get a GPS fix after a timeout. However, a typical GPS in a phone takes the most power when it trys to get the fix and the power consumption is much reduced after getting/keeping the fix. 

So it would be nice to have two timeout values. One as it is right now with the ""absolute timeout"". So it could be set to e.g. 90 seconds, so the phone has enough time to get a fix even in a GPS cold-start condition in difficult reception conditions. 

And a second timeout, which aborts, in case after X seconds there are still 0 satellites in view. This value then could be e.g. set to 20 seconds. 

So in case of definite no reception (like in the garage) the phone would then run only on for 20 seconds, but has enough timeout for difficult GPS reception conditions.

Well, the server is configured pretty tight and supports only TLS 1.2. To my knowledge, this should be supported by Android 4.4 and up. (The browser could access the website pretty well)

I don't like to downgrade the server again to the not secure TLS versions again, so is there a way to fix this on the client side ?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,"Annotation actually creates a Way Point (sets ""name"", probably should set ""description"")",[],"I'm viewing the waypoints in another app and its not 100% happy so I started looking into the issue, I think that the ""name"" should be a fixed value for the type of waypoint (say ""GpsLogger"") and its the description field that contains the text, that way the waypoints can be visualised with pins when viewed on a map. 

From what I can see If we could define our own ""types"" say ""playground"", park or ""stay away"" etc, then these can be configured to display in different types and colors of pins.

It seems to me that ""annotate"" should be renamed ""waypoint"" and perhaps support other waypoint properties.

Incidentally does someone know how can I turn the high accuracy mode off by default on unrooted device?

I use the exact same format from a browser with the same user:password and it works.
The first time I used this from the browser, the server (or the browser, I am not sure which) generated a pop-up window asking if I wanted to sign in with user and password.  I said yes and all was good; no explicit typing of user or password required.

If, using GPS Logger, I use the format without the user:password@ and remove the authentication from the directory, all works (but obviously I want authentication)

My site is on GoDaddy.  Not sure if they do some funny things or not, but just wanted to share full info.

Question:
1) Am I using the correct format?

2) Is there a step I am missing?  
The confirmation I needed to click when using the browser (Chrome) makes me wonder if the GPS Logger custom URL option is being asked to confirm as well and not doing so.

I have often the problem that I have gps fixes most of the time and in between I have a network based point... this makes the final gpx-file look very ugly because the net based fix is mostly very inaccurate and has no altitude information. 
I would propose that net based fixes are only taken if the last gps fix is older than X seconds. X might be configurable as such, or be a multiple of the usual time between points. For example, if I log once a minute and the last 5 minutes (X=5 or X=300seconds) I didn't get a gps fix, then (and only then) log the net based point. I do prefer a 5 minute empty time range, than a flickering gpx file.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Some feature requests and suggestions,[],"Hi Mendhak, all!

First of all let me thank you because your Android app EXCEL!
Very very well done both in terms of features, and presentation.

I sent a 5 star rank in google play  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger

Also this project readme is great beacuse you show very well how to build up all! 

Here below a mix of suggestiones/change requests/thoughts. Not real issues, so close this if you prefer!
## 1. Donation / payment (business model suggestion)

We are here and so your project is also open source. Great!
I invite you to take donations not just with bitcoins, but maybe with mor common payment gateway donation as Paypal...
I think that your app is so well done that it deserve a payment for download, even if open source. ut maybe there is some ""contradiction"" in terms of licence. I don't know but my statements here if to share with you my appreciation.
## 2. Download with automatic configuration (possible change request)

Your app is  really complete in configuration options, and a bit complex also fort an IT guy.

Please consider the scenario where you are a supplier of some service to not expert people. 
Right now they have to go to google play, download the app and do a not so intuitive configuration for some specific fine-tuning needs.
In my case I would realize some back-end application server that track people and I would use your feature that in real-time send coordinates to a custom URL (already tested, excellent again!)
So in the describe case I have also to configure carefully the URL and some other configurations.

My naif question (maybe not directly related to your specific app) is: there is a way to build up an ""invitation"" behaviour so I could send by example some HTTP link containing all a non technical user need to download (from Google Play) and get the app configured with some Preset configuration (by example containing all data to set in the device the performance tuning settings and the URL to send data ) ?
In other words, my request is that app could ""download"" a configuration file ... 
All this make sense ?
## 3. Share Intent to Gmail: Google Maps vs  openstreetmaps (change request)

Now, in my phone If I click on the icon in the down menu at right, I can share intent and I can select Gmail (mail client installed).

Gpslogger in this case prepare a mail containing by example something like:

```
http://maps.google.com/maps?q=44.4101087,8.9589158
```

That's fine (using Google Maps) but I'd love to instead use OpenStreetMap as default locations viewer, in that case the above link could substutute with something like this one:

```
http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=44.4101087&mlon=8.9589158&zoom=18
```

That's a minor point, for sure. But please note openstreetmap is fully ""compliant"" with the open source philosophy; Google ... so and so :)
Seriously, openstreetmap in my city as you could imagine: Genova, Italy, count a growing up community and maps are pheraps more detailed in comparison with Google Map. No polemic, just a verification.
## 4. Cella antenna location slow (minor issue/ request)

I just start doing some test but I just noted that the localization using just cell operator antennas (great feature in some case and for battery usage saving, Thanks again for your specific attention on this!), require a lot of minutes, in case I move by example with car in a new location.
I do som tests with a Samsung S2 phone, with Android 4.2.2.
I read in the FAQ you mention points: ""the long time to find a fix"" and the ""interval time passed without lany log"". But it seems you talk about cell network localization specifically. 
Maybe could help some front-end advise (and also in the realtime HTTP GET ) to point out ""no data available by cella phone"" or ""getting coordinates from cell antennas"" someting like that.
## 5. Logging at scheduled intervals (""crontab"" like). Minor request

It could be helpfull to let configure some fixed times in a day where the tracking must be active. Maybe in coincidence with working time. Eg. Every week, Monday to  Friday, from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. 
Maybe with a crontab syntax.
## 6. Statistics about power consumption and  tracking accouracy in different location input: GPS/WIFI/Cellular Antennas.

Do you pheraps did some test to compare performances related to 
- power consumption
- tracking accouracy

in three different scenarios 
- GPS
- WIFI
- Cellular Antennas
- Merging above 
  ?

I'm very interested in a super-efficient battery usage.

Sorry for my long write, that's my contibution, I hope.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Annotate button to create waypoints,[],"I tried to understand the code, but it is not easy. Do you think it is feasible to get the following logics:

1) User presses Annotate button
2) Retrieve location from the system immediately, ignoring the configured AppSettings.minimumSeconds (at least as fast as possible, probably 1000ms, but if it takes longer that also doesn't hurt)
3) As soon as location has been delivered by the system, remember it and open the dialog to get the descriptive text from the user
4) As soon as the text is ready, the remembered location and descriptive text can be stored to the file as a waypoint

It might take the user longer to type in the descriptive text than the AppSettings.minimumSeconds value. So if possible, regular, periodic logging should continue irrespective of the pending dialog. But if this is too complicate, it is not necessary.

You are using EventBus and it's hard to understand the logics. But roughly speaking it would be
- Each point dropping out of the listener must ""know"" whether it is a regular (periodic) point or one created by pressing Annotate. 
- If ""I was created by Annotate, then the descriptive text, as soon as it is available (OK pressed) is for me  and I can be saved as a waypoint""
- If ""I am an ordinary, periodic (AppSettings.minimumSeconds) point, I can be stored immediately as a trackpoint""

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Massive data usage problem,[],"First off, thanks for the great app! I've been using happily for over 3 years now!

Over the last month, I took an international trip, and the app reportedly used massive amounts of data. My setup was like this:
- GPSLogger runs continuously on my phone
- GPSLogger is set to log to GPX, create a new file every day, log not more than every 20 seconds and with a minimum distance between points of 10m, and set to upload to Dropbox every 60 minutes and when I stop logging
- my phone doesn't have cell data (international roaming was way too expensive), but I would sometime tether my phone (via wifi) to a friend's phone who did have cell data.
- their phone data would go in and out, depending on cell reception

By way of comparision, the GPX files created over the 2 weeks of this trip total 1.29MB.

Any idea what is going on, or how to prevent this much data usage?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Wrong resource names in country codes,[],"I cannot build with Android Studio anymore. Reason and fix: The names of the resource directories like for example ""values-es-ES"" seem to be incorrect.

The docu (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources) says this should rather be ""values-es-rES"". If I rename it like this (and the other ""values-xx-XX"" analogously), Android Studio works again. 

Not sure when this issue started, in the past, building always worked. Maybe it's because I upgraded A.S. to 1.3.1.

When you log you position, and you stay at the same place, you have the first point which is logged

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,App stop after a few hours of logging,[],"I had a trip two weeks ago and used GPS Logger to record my track every day.

I was always able to click ""Start Logging"" again when I re-entered the app, so I knew that the previous session ended indeed and the logging had stopped. There was no error message on the screen so I don't know if the app crashed / ended gracefully / got kicked out by some other app.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Better visibility of a failure to write to file,[],"Suppose that one way or another, the path configured for storing tracks doesn't exist and cannot be created. GPS Logger even shows it in red in the settings in this case.

Unfortunately GPS Logger never actually informs the user that it is unable to perform its sole function. What happens is I hit ""record"", I see the status change from ""Obtaining GPS"" to ""Inaccurate point discarded"" to ""Only 0.0 m travelled. Point discarded"" to eventually ""Started"". There is literally no way for the user to confirm whether a file is being written to or not (as far as I can tell).

What I'd expect to happen is to be shouted at with a huge red message to the tune of ""!!! ERROR! NOTHING IS BEING RECORDED! FIX IT !!!"", but nothing like that happens. I've checked the code and it looks like it's supposed to say ""Could not write to file"" on a write exception, but this status must be getting overwritten elsewhere. Possibly by the next call to SetStatus(R.string.started)?

Suggestions:
1. For file loggers only, try to actually write to a file when the user presses ""Start"", and complain right away if there's a problem. Before a GPS fix is even obtained.
2. If an error status is set, it should be sticky; it shouldn't get overridden by ""Started"" or other relatively inconsequential messages.

This has cost me two tracks so far, the most recent of which was pretty important to me...

So I was thinking, what if you could tell the app that you are walking, in that way it knows you'll most likely not be going more than 10km/h? Similar for running or biking, there are certain limits that could help in dropping noisy points.

The difficulty would be that if you would get on a bus for example, and then continue, it should only drop the bus points, and afterwards the points are again close enough to each-other, so it can continue.

However every few days (havent worked out if its random or not) it creates a new folder of the same name (google drive doesnt have any issue with duplicate folder names it seems).
Im sure this isnt the expected behaviour.
It is frustrating to me as i share that folder with another google user and when a new folder is made that user cant see any new data.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Notification when no fix is acquired over time,[],"I've got a spare phone where I'm turning off wifi/bt/sync, don't have a sim card in it, run it on airplane mode and underclock the CPU. GPSLogger seems to do up to about 30 hours on it which is good enough for me. I am actually keeping the GPS on between points and it seem to draw around 75mA only; with an extended battery I could probably go for a week this way. 

However, I would like it to notify me with an alarm type notification if it isn't working correctly. 

I am thinking of it in a time limit sense; for instance, if no fix has been acquired in the last X minutes (configurable), notify me with an alarm until I dismiss it (to maybe reboot the device, or otherwise check what's going on). 

There may be other/better ways to determine that it isn't working correctly but that would make most sense to my use case where I use GPS only and have it active all the time.

Would this be possible to implement?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,logged GPX files disappearing in new version,[],"Hello,
at first, I'd like to send you a big thank for the app! It's great and the only one which meets my requirements.
I use it for months to track my car tracks and start and end the tracking automatically by tasker and intents when my phone is connected/disconnected to my HF in car.

Now in version 62 it seems not to work properly as it looks like it is deleting the recorded file (or somewhat like that) when it is stopped from tasker and the phone is not active. When I have my screen on, it seems to be OK.

Could it be related to changes in ver 61?

My scenario is to have my phone not active and automatically start and finish the logging, which is not working now.

Is there any way to downgrade the app and keep the settings?

Thx a lot for your answer.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,logging breaks after each update,[],"I've got GPS logger set up to create gpx tracks in the default folder (/storage/extSdCard/Android/data/com.mendhack.gpslogger/files) and upload them automatically to google drive when logging is stopped. GPS logger has been updated quite a few times recently and after each update logging broke down - no logs were created in the folder even though GPS logger appeared to be running and showed the icon in the status bar. Uploading a test file from GPS tracker to google drive worked and resolved the issues until the next upgrade so this issue is possibly drive- or auto-upload related.

However, I can see the file in the folder using a file manager on my phone.

Currently, my workaround is to cause a media rescan of the GPX folder using SD Scanner (or simply reboot the phone). But it would be much easier, if GPSLogger could simply register the file once it finished recording.

Setting the USB mode to mass storage device might be a solution, but unfortunately, this is not an option anymore on many devices.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,FIFO buffer for CustomURL,[],"Sometimes I ask again to you for transmission FIFO buffering during CustomURL transmission.

This can help if you are recording your trip to a real-time server (i.e. my motolive.zapto.org server) and during a trip (i.e. with car or motorcycle) you loose 2G/3G signal for some minutes (because you are into a long road tunnel or in the middle of mountains). 
GPSLogger should save unsent data into a simple buffer (i.e. a simple array) and when data can be sent again, all data saved into buffer are uploaded remotely (and buffer is now empty).

I asked this in issue #195 :
_Is it possible in Android to set a static array (like C, an array that doesn't loose it content) ?
If answer is yes, set a sized FIFO memory buffer. About 50 or 100 KBytes is enough. Or limit it to a maximim number of entries (1000 records ?). If buffer is full, oldest data are deleted and newest data are recorded. Obviously you can loose some data (but full data are available into GPX/KML file if enabled).
Add a simple static FIFO buffer into CustomUrlJob.java  public void onRun() function. 
Add en external loop to onrun() try / catch main code. The loop check if buffer is not empty and run many time the try/catch code.
If website is not reacheable (or it's answer is not 200 OK), the catch code add parameters into FIFO buffer.
If website is reacheable and its answer is 200 OK, looping try/catch will send over and over again URL until buffer is empty._

Really, it's a very simple change to your code. I cannot do it myself because I've never write Java code and I've never programmed with Android.
Are only a dozen rows of Java code , more or less :-) :-) :-)

We are a german water rescue organisation and we would like to use your app to track our boats.
It would be very very helpful, if we could get a ""foolproof"" version:
- NO configuration possible at all. Just the possibility to type in a 1-2 digit boat number before activating the sending of positions.
- 10 colored buttons (1-9 and 0) as the only visible objects beneath LAT and LON while sending is activated. Number of last pressed button has to be sent within the link.
- Send positions only via link to our perl script at www....../cgi-bin/....?id=%boatno;stat:$button;lat=%LAT....

Could that be possible?

It would be a giant help for us and our targets!

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,The Displayed Speed in Miles Per Hour is Wrong,[],"When using imperial units the displayed speed in MPH is incorrect. If I switch the display to metric it shows me roughly the speed (this time in KPH) that I expect.

| Car Speed (KPH) | GPSLogger Speed (MPH) |

| 30 | 5 |
| 50 | 9 |
| 60 | 11 |

The phone I'm using is a Nexus 5 running 5.0.1 with stock everything. The GPSLogger version is 56. I don't think this is a regression from the previous version as I remember thinking the speed in MPH was odd before, but I normally use metric so I haven't really paid attention.

This would add the annotation to all the points in that GPX, or URL pings, etc., until the stop button is pressed (when going more than one point at a time) or until the sticky annotation is changed/unset (not sure what would happen if there is a one-time/regular/single-point annotation set while the sticky one is set. perhaps they can be mutually exclusive?).

It would also be nice to have this functionality exposed in the intent interface (perhaps this is even more useful that this feature being exposed in the UI).

One reason this is so useful is because it exposes a neat way for an end user to customize or send data to a service, etc.

P.S. Thank you for the wonderful app! :-)

mendhak/gpslogger,open,Feature request: Offline cell tower positioning,[],"Hi,

I am a big fan of the cell tower location feature in GPSlogger. However, when I travel with my mobile in Europe, I generally turn the data  feature off to avoid the horrendous roaming costs. This unfortunattely makes it impossible to use GPSlogger's cell location feature. I would therefore like to propose a feature that logs the cell-tower ID but doesn't convert it to a lat-long. The post-processing of the cell tower ids to gett long-lat coordinates could then be instigated  at a later time by the user  once they have an affordable data connection..

Cheers,

This app is an excellent piece of work! Congrats!

I just finished setting up own OpenGTS server and I've managed to log to it from my phone using GPS Logger.
But I don't know how to set it up to continue logging even when the phone looses data connectivity (weak signal, roaming, ...). I would expect a local buffer that gets submitted after data connection is restored. Is there any feature like that?

I also came to that idea to not to ""log to"" my OpenGTS, but instead upload the gpx file, but according to the OpenGTS documentation, I would need to change the path from /gprmc/Data to /event/... and another problem is, that OpenGTS is expecting username and pass for that kind of event as well.

In your app, what exactly is the difference between log to openGTS and autosend to openGTS? For me, logging works, autosending doesn't get processed serverside.

It looks that annotations was not sent because I set Distance Filter to 30mt. Obviously when I write the annotation I was stopped and Distance Filter discard the point.
But in my opinion Annotations should be ALWAYS sent to remote server ignoring  Distance Filter.
Some other Filters should be ignored ? Accuracy ?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,OpenGTS fixes in querystring,[],
mendhak/gpslogger,open,Unable to log position from wifi and cell only,[],"I have been using the app on Android 2.3 with GPS disabled and Google Location services enabled. My purpose is the research the quality of WiFi positioning and it has served me very well. I recently switched to a Galaxy S4 and now only get WiFi based fixes when the phone is associated with an AP. I do still get cell based positions, but those are not important to me. I've made all the changes I can think of to make sure the WiFi radio is always on.
Any thoughts?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Custom URL HTTP transmission problem: missing some data (OpenGTS works fine),[],"Since yesterday I'm trying to use gpslogger with OpenGTS ""AND"" CustomURL enabled.
Every time the app fix and acquire a point, it send twice to my server:
- once with OpenGTS 
- once with CustomURL
  in the same time (more or less).

This is a log example:
---- Data.php ---- 2014-04-22 17:17:55
/**_?alt=192.0&code=0xF020&id=ambrosa%2C+**_***_&gprmc=%24GPRMC%2C151752.129%2CA%2C4**_.78935%2CN%2C9*_.55610%2CE%2C4.859611%2C34.099998%2C220414%2C%2C_3B

---

---- track.php ---- 2014-04-22 17:17:55
/**_?u=ambrosa&p=**_**&lat=**.52982251&lon=**.34260172&time=2014-04-22T15:17:52Z&desc=&sat=20&alt=192.0&spd=2.5&acc=17.0&dir=34.1&prov=gps&batt=58.0&aid=****_a1fae26a&ser=**_**380G

---

Well, OpenGTS transmission is very reliable: hundred points transmitted correctly.
But there something strange about CustomURL: no point is transmitted. ONLY for CustomURL. 
Very very strange. I don't receive about 15% points, as there is no app transmission. But I correclty receive the OpenGTS transmission.

There is something wrong in CustomURL HTTP transmission.

How can I debug ? Do I enable debug into setup ?

I'm not yet a fan of the new interface. I'm experiencing some bugs that I hope you can resolve eventually:
- The Auto send and Upload to fields are blank even though I've entered in the data.
- The Log Once button (looks like a [1]) isn't clickable
- The Upload to Dropbox feature doesn't seem to work if uploading the .zip file now

Could you take a look and see if you can reproduce these?

Thanks

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Custom URL Logging broken,[],"First off I love this app. Simple, yet feature rich and fast even on my sluggish Motorola Defy. Also I'm currently traveling through Iran where Google Play is blocked so having a ready made .apk was just awesome. **Big fat thumbs up.**

I was planning on using this app to publish my GPS coordinates to my server and then display them using gmaps on my blog.

**TLDR; actual Issue:** When I change the custom URL under `Custom URL Logging` and set the checkbox `Log to custom URL` it won't save. Going back and returning will show me the default localhost value again.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Logging setting precision,[],"In ""Logging settings"", there is an ""Accuracy before logging"" option with ""Which min. accuracy to for logging"" description. I think it would be better to rename the option in ""Accuracy filter"" with a ""Precision required for logged point to be save"" description.

When I first used this option, I had understood that it will try to fix a GPS point until it is under the accuracy expected but actually it filters fixes that are in accuracy range before saving.

I would also limit a minimum range of 5m as civilian GPS can't fix a point under this accuracy.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,OpenGTS,[],"Sorry I can't commit any changes, but am experiencing an issue with the latest version and OpenGTS.
Server is expecting http://example.com:8080/gprmc/Data?acct=ACCOUNTNAME&dev=DEVICEID&gprmc=$GPRMC,(gpsdata)
What it is being sent (as far as debug shows, anyway) is:

I'm way too new to even try tackling a code change in this, I wouldn't even know where to start.  But the OpenGTS doesn't appear to be sending the data my server is expecting, so is not receiving an ""OK"" response.
Would someone be able to look into this, possibly verify that the send data is formatted correctly?

- I click on pencil icon, I write my 'note' and I click OK. In my remote server I receive TWO identical records: the first one with %DESC='' (empty) and the second one with %DESC correctly set with my 'note'. GPSLogger is sending data twice with difference only in %DESC parameter.

I suppose that the behaviour origin is how this informations is recorded into KML/GPX file. It's recorded twice: one for 'place' and the other one for 'track'
But receiving two identical location is confusing for Custom URL
Can you change the code only for Custom URL to transmit only one record (with %DESC) ?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Google Drive upload problem: wrong MIME type,[],"Today I've made a trip with my motorbike and I've recorded it as usual with GPSLogger.
And then, as usual, I've uploaded .KML file into my Google Drive. Upload was ok.

But I cannot view the 'preview' using the Google Drive web interface.
Since about 1 years ago I've uploaded and previewed kml file without any problem.
Old files are ok: I can see the preview.
New files are NOT ok: I cannot see the preview. Strange.

I've found the difference:
old files have MIME type ""application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"" example: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7FOsjwNpro_NTFFZ2pMcTlNVGs

new files have MIME ""application/xml"" and obviously GDrive cannot preview them example: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7FOsjwNpro_N3hNUERpdnNtT1k 

If I open both files with a text editor, I cannot see any difference. New files are really correct KML file. The problem it's only the MIME type
GPSLogger now set the file type during upload as XML and not as KML.
9-12 months ago all was fine, today not.

If I download the file into my PC and simply I re-upload it into GDrive (always using my PC), magically now it has the correct MIME: GDrive recognize it as KML and set the correct MIME. So it looks to be a GPSLogger issue.

Mendhak, Have you changed something ? Or are the new Google Drive API ?

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Cosmetic suggestion about data accuracy in main screen,[],"Ver 38 and some version older.

In main screen altitude and speed are showed with a very high accuracy.
See my screenshot http://postimg.org/image/w4rtiv2o9/

Speed 4.02249224

In my opinion this is confusing. Using only 1 or 2 digit can be ok.
I.e.
Altitude 267.8 meters
Speed 4.0 m/s
Who care for altitude and speed after the first digit ?

Obviously data saved/transmitted should have maximium accuracy. But .... is it correct ? Or also for data saved/transmitted it's enough to use 1 or 2 digit ? I don't know

the problem is that position (http://maps.google.com/maps?q= ...) into mail,whatsup.... is showed ONLY when a track recording is running.
1b)
If a track recording is NOT running and you record a single point (yes, you have obtained correctly the position), there are no info to share into mail,whatsup....

2)
if you have not any position showed in main screen (i.e. you have just started the app) and if you want to share your position, the app should be automatically start a ""single point"" process to obtain the position.

I don't really know if it's a bug or a mis-configuration, but here is my issue.
Sometimes, I guess mostly when I'm immobile and in a place with a lower coverage satellites, it happens that a position (or often a few position in succession) is suddenly logged (therefore likely detected by the GPS) in a totally absurd place (eg thousands kms from the previous position) .
Is this a bug ? If so can it be fixed.
Or maybe a proper configuration can get around (or circumvent) the issue ?

Many thanks for this great app!
I would ask you if is possible to add to the saved file a id-device field, manually defined or better a unique device id, as the IMEI number.
I'm using it to send location data from my collegues to our openGTS server; but when location is not covered by 3G net the point data are lost, so I set a time interval to send a data file to a ftp server and eventually add lost points if needed.
If I upload these files in the same folder of the ftp server, I can't understand what is the device. I could create and specify a unique folder for each collegue, but it should be better to receive the id from the app.
Thanks for your time.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,"New ""http"" sender ?",[],"Hi mendhak, I'm the Italian translator :-)

I'm looking for a GPS app that can be used as a real time tracker, as www.greenalp.com and its Real Time GPS Tracker app do.

I want, just for fun, build a simple web tracker public viewer. More or less as OpenGTS or GreenALP.
And GPSLogger can be the perfect Android client.

Can you add to GPSLogger a simple ""http sender"" : Android user provide an URL that can be expanded with variables

I.e. 
http://www.mywebsite.com/record.php?user=ambrosa&password=QwrtY18&lat=%L&lon=%G&prec=%P&battery=%B ............

where %L is expanded by GPSLogger as latitude, %G as longitude , %P as gps precision , %B battery charge level, %M as mode (GPS vs Cell tower)  and so on .....
The variables above are only provided by me as examples, but can be a good starting point.
And every time GPSLogger record a position, it contact the url above and transmit data.
Remote webserver can simple answer with strings ""OK"" or ""NOK"" (or timeout)

In next summer I'm planning a 10.000 Km trip with my motorcycle around nord Europe (including Russia and NordKapp) and I wish to develope a service like greenalp but more simple and easy.
But I've never write code for Android system. And GPSLogger already exists. Why remade job ? :-)

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Log is stored in internal memory instead SD card on Sony Xperia L,[],"I am using a Sony Xperia L with a physical  SD card installed in the card slot. But GPSLogger still writes the gpx-logs to the internal memory instead of the SD card. What can be done about this?

This is what I found out by myself: I installed Total Commander to look at the filesystem on the phone. It seems (any google confirms) that the Sony Xperia L has partitioned the built-in-memory into to partitions, ""Gerätespeicher"" (device memory) and ""Interner Speicher"" (internal memory) with the later one mounted at /sdcard. I find this strange as it is internal memory and the name of the mount point would suggest an sd-card, but this is how sony does it (I don't know about phones other than the Xperia L). The plugged-in real SD-card is mounted at /ext_card which GPSLogger unfortunately ignores. The logs are written to /sdcard/GPSLogger/*.gpx which is in the internal memory of the phone.

Is there any way to make GPSLogger recognize the situation and write to /ext_card/GPSLogger instead? Or preferably select or specifiy a logging directory by the user's choice?

"
mendhak/gpslogger,closed,"Modified annotation behaviour, to allow annotations to be made at any time",[],"When the user requests an annotation to be made, a new fix is requested from the logging service. The annotation is then added to that fix as soon at it becomes available.

Details:

The annotation menu icon is modified while an annotation is pending. This provides feedback that the annotation is being logged. If the user selects the ""annotate"" menu item again at that point, the annotation text can be edited or removed. The latter is useful if no GPS fix was received while the user was still in the vicinity of the location that she wanted to annotate, so that the annotation is now irrelevant.

When logging an annotation, the limits on time and distance between points are temporarlily relaxed. If no logging session is in progress, ""single point"" logging will be activated. Otherwise, we just request a new point.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Option to start logging automatically when app is launched,[],"Hello,

I really think that GPSLogger is a very great app. I'm using it to log data to my personal OpenGTS server. What I miss is the possibility to start the logging once the app is launched. I want to start the logging as soon as my phone connects to my cars bluetooth hands free system. With the app ""MyProfiles"" I can launch GPSLogger as soon as the phone is connected via BT in my car, but unfortuneatly the app is not logging data without starting it manually. 

So I think an option in the Settings Menu would be a good choice to customize the app.

Thanks and best regards

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,IGC logger + small change in API,[],"I'm currently trying to make a small set of patches for adding support of different loggers (IGC file, skylines livetracking, livetrack24 livetracking).

I'm first trying to add the IGC logger. The thing is that for some usage (paraglider competition), a signature should be added at the end of the file. Problem is that gpslogger does not have a callback for ""closing"" a logger (only write, annotate and getName).
I can see that f-e for the GPX logger, for each point, it writes at a given offset within the output file.
Following this approach would require the IGC logger to update the signature with every point, which is overkill.

Do you think it would be possible to add a callback for that ? I guess that should be possible, but I'm only starting to look into gpslogger :). I'm not asking you to do it, I will happily provide a patch, I simply would like to know if it is something easy and doable :)

"
mendhak/gpslogger,open,Feature Request : Adjust the refresh interval to movement,[],"I use your app to log my position from sunrise to sunset, and it meets the need.
But there is a big part of the day during which I (and the phone) do not move. And during this period, that would be nice to have less waypoints recorded as they become useless. And this would meet another requirement : to save battery.
So here is my idea to implement this : the app should detect that if during XX seconds/minutes (choice of the user), the position remains the same (what is a postion that remains the same ? This is to be determined but it could be for example the fact that the position remains in a circle of 15-20meters of diameter), then the refresh interval should decrease to XX seconds/minutes (choice of the user).
Example : I set a refresh interval of 10 seconds. If the app detects that my position has been the same for 5 minutes, the refresh interval is set to 2 minutes.
Then, when the app detects that the position has changed, the refresh interval is set back to the first value. Drawback : in my example, you lose up to 2 minutes of logging if you decide to move just after a waypoint when the app is in ""immobile state"".

That would meet in fact 3 needs : save battery, clarify the path when you look your global recording on a map (without a bunch of waypoints when you're immobile) and in the end do what the application should be : be accurate and record when you move and do not be when you don't move (but still records as the primary goal is to make a continuous recording).

Then I thought to a way to improve this. However I don't know if this is feasible.
The detection of immobility or mainly the end of immobility could be done with the addition of the use of the accelerometer. For the detection of immobility, I think this must be the GPS AND the accelerometer and not only the accelerometer, because you can move with no acceleration (eg in a train), and you want the app to record your postions.
So if the app detects that the position remains the same (as described above) and the accelerometer confirms that, then the refresh interval decrease.
And it becomes more effective when you want to detect the resuming of movement. This should be coded as a OR : if the position is not the same anymore OR the accelerometer detects a movement, then the refresh interval is set back to the first value.
In the end, this should be an option for the user to take advantage of the accelerometer (with a ""Use accelerometer"" check) and with a slide to adjust sensitivity.

I hope all this is not too confusing because English is not my mother tongue.

I picked the longest delay for sending 8 hours, because I don't need the tracks right away, I just want them backed up. I also have the feature for a separate GPX file per day turned on. The problem is that it's not uploading the old logs...if it auto sends at say 8pm on Jan 5th, the next send will be at 4am on Jan 6th, and it ONLY sends the jan6 gpx file, not the jan 5. So on the device, the jan 5 gpx file runs up until 11:59pm, but on the server, the jan 5 gpx file only contains data up until 8pm.

Solution: When auto sending, send all GPX files that were updated since the last send.
Perhaps easier solution: Just always send the last two files, instead of the last file (that should solve most cases, but maybe not all).

I believe if you implemented issue #116, that would be an acceptable workaround for this bug. Thanks!
"
mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Accuracy: Adding components of HDOP and mean SNR,[],"In assessing the precision of a GPS track for mapping, HDOP is useful but is only part of the story. (see http://www.outdoormaps.org/?p=138 for discussion and links).

First: HDOP (horizontal dilution of precision) is the quadratic mean of ""EDOP"" (easting DOP) and ""NDOP"" (northing DOP).
If we had both EDOP and NDOP, we could represent the DOP in JOSM as an ellipse instead of a circle (as in http://www.outdoormaps.org/?p=128).
Use case: You have two GPS tracks. On both, you went through Queen's road and King's road.
On Queen's Road, the two GPX tracks are 50 meters apart, one (track A) on the east, the other on the west (track B). Track B has both high EDOP and NDOP on all points. Track A has high NDOP but very low EDOP. So, for the purpose of mapping a road oriented north-south, track A is very good. You discard track B and map Queen's Road on top of track A.

On King's Road, the two GPX tracks are 50 meters apart, one (track A) on the east, the other on the west (track B). Both tracks A and B have high EDOP and NDOP on all points of King's road. You draw  King's Road in the middle, at an equal distance of tracks A and B. (In OpenStreetMap, you may add those tags: fixme=resurvey; note=averaged from 2 low-precision GPS tracks).

Editors like JOSM would show the DOP like an ellipse, not like a circle

I provide some working prototype code (in R) and alink to the maths on how to do this at http://www.outdoormaps.org/?p=138; nothing hard here, tell me if I can help.

(A further improvement would be actually to store the direction of the highest DOP: this may not always be north-south or east-west).

---

Second: DOP conveys only the information on the position of the satellite. As discussed in the above link, SNR is equally important. One or more satellite(s) with a very low SNR may signal reflections or signal that is so low that it becomes barely usable.
Mean SNR (accross all used satellites) is probably an excellent start.
In particular according to one scientific reference[1], it is useful in combination to the number of satellites. 
Ref [1] presents a use case. Another one would be to have circles/ellipse in JOSM that would show the accuracy based on combining xDOP and SNR.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Time in text file output and altitude on display and in output files,[],"Hello Mendhak

Thanks for this great app. It works perfectly for my purposes except for one small time zone output problem and one large altitude value problem.

Regarding time output: Is the usage of UTC on text file output due to GPX output requirements? Am I right to understand that local time output within the text file is impossible?

Regarding altitude values: For the altitude I am getting unusual negative values on the display and output file. I am in Sri Lanka and am expecting altitude/elevation values of roughly 20 to 30m but am getting values between -65m and -75m both on the display and in the text file. I have verified the altitude using other GPS apps and DEM data from satellites. If I set imperial units it seems to produce negative values but now in feet. Hence instead of 60 to 95 feet I am getting -210 to -249 feet. I do not see any settings for altitude calculations. Is the altitude values due to some assumption about the Earth as a spheroid or something else?

Thanks

If you open them in Viking or JOSM you'll see that the second last track point is at lat/lon 0.0, but when looking at the source of the gpx I have found no such point, so there must be something broken in the syntax or something.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Feature request: Support for higher-frequenzy (i.e 10hz) logging,[],"I bought a Qstarz 818xt 10hz logger that can send 10 positions a second, making 0.1 seconds between positions. This makes the 1 second lower cap (brought on by minimumSeconds being an int) on time intervals in gpslogger too big to log all received positions.

I tried setting the time interval to 0 but the results were not nice with a largely unresponsive system as result.

As a hack to get all my wanted positions logged i changed 3 occurrences of minimumSeconds_1000 to minimumSeconds_100, effectively making the least considered unit of time a tenth of a second rather than a second. If minimumSeconds is set to 1, gpslogger now receives positions every 0.1 seconds as wanted.

A proper fix would probably be to make minimumSeconds a float instead.

Would it be possible to have a predictive distance setting which checks the distance between the last 2 points to obtain speed then alter the next call for logging accordingly.

e.g. point 1 at x=0m y=0m, then when point 2 5 minutes later is logged at x=1000m y=0m (1km change)

1000/(60*5) = ~3mps so if logging is set at 10m the next log would fire ~3 seconds later so

0:05:00 x=1000 y=0

I suppose the way it could work is for it to parse and iterate through any kml/gpx files it finds, and upload any 'pending' gps position logs. I would guess the kml/gpx entries would need to be tagged somehow in order to skip them the next time.

Scheduling an upload (every x min/hours/days etc) as well as a manual upload method would be good too.

  - Phone was connected to PC
- Apart from that, one can't check if the logging is really still running, as there is no possibility to see the log files through the app.

I am into the process of starting life logging and therefore your GPSLogger would be _the_ central element for my system.

I tested GPSLogger for four days and I do shut down my phone when I go to sleep and reboot when I rise in the morning.

My settings were: (day 1:) Log to KML, New file creation once a day, [x] prefer celltowers, time: 30min, distance: 900meters, [x] start at bootup, 

day 1: I expected two log entries for each hour being awake and/or one entry for moving further than 900 meters. What I got: three entries over the whole day: one at home, one while being at an appointment and one in the city roughly 300m away from where I've been.

day 2: I changed settings to 600s (=10min) and 250m (and disabling notification icon). On this day I got two entries: both more or less at home. But I was definitely away from home for several hours.

day 3: no entry at all.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,GPSLogger intervals affects other GPS based applications and vice-versa,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","There have been complaints about setting an interval in GPSLogger (such as 30 seconds) and this in turn affecting other applications (such as Google Maps).  Typically, I wasn't seeing this problem and ""it worked on my machine"".  On holiday recently, I finally saw this issue.  I had 30 seconds set in the GPSLogger app, and I noticed that Google Maps was only updating after 30 seconds.  I then found the following issues:

http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/138463dc099a3d8d?pli=1

Alright, so it looks like the first GPS interval that's set will affect the others.  Awful...

This means that I have to change the way that GPS locations are read, I've created this separate issue as it's a bigger task.  

First, I need to see if there's something wrong with the way I'm using requestLocationUpdates.  This also means looking for what other people have done.  I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.

I'll then have to change the logger so that it uses a timer/alarm to nudge the application which in turn does a requestLocationUpdates call immediately.  

This will mean that the app loses the log every x meters feature, there won't be any more distance, it'll have to be time only.  I really want to avoid this, I hope to find a better way.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,GPSlogger stops logging,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Hello,
I have been using gpslogger for a few days and I have some issues, which I can't solve.
I hope I'm right submitting them here, feel free to correct me if needed.

First let me say that I am VERY happy to have that piece of software: it is exactly what I was looking for. So: THANKS !!

Context:
Phone: HTC desire, S-offed and rooted
Android: 2.3.3, Oxygen 2.0.2 rom (see on XDA) 
Kernel 2.6.35.11-thalamus

Main annoyance: 
Every once in a while, usually after a few hours, GPS logger stops logging without apparent cause.
The status drop-down says ""gpslogger is still running"" but no coordinates, and when I go into the program, button is greyed and I have to press it to restart logging.
Log files show no pattern in time (log stopped over the last few days at  2:00, 9:30, 23:30, 3:00, 2:00, 7:59)
I tried to disable juice defender: no result.
The problem happens in gps mode and cell towers only mode.
PS: an change of Icon in the status bar, indicating ""green= i'm logging"" and ""blue= running but idle"" would be a nice addition I think.

Second annoyance:
the gpx produced aren't compatible with garmin mapsource. File format issue ?

Third annoyance:
I tried to enable sending the log by email: the program forced closed instantly and would not start again. I had to delete the configuration before being able to run it again. 

Conclusion: only the first issue is important to me, the other two I can live with.
Thanks.

Settings Request (features)

Hi,

Motorola Spice XT300 with android 2.1 rooted. I am very impressed with this little application so thank you to the developers.

Is anybody still working on this application? I was hoping someone could add in a couple of settings for the application.

First:

When a new log file is created alow the user to give a meaningfull text name to be appended to the datestamp used as the log filename. This could then be turned on and off using the settings the same as you can sellect for a new file to be started each time you start logging. I would imaging this would be done as a user hits ""Start logging"" just before the new file is created pop up a screen that will accept a text name.

This is because I have about 15 logs on my SD card and i have no idea what they were all for. They are Date stamped but there is no context. So if I took 3 different trips in a day I have no idea what they were for.

Second:

I would like to be able to Set the log save location through the settings screen rather than it just defaulting to the root of the SD card. That way if i want it to save directly to the dropbox (if they ever fix the sync issue). All i have to do is change the log folder location. There is nothing wrong with having a default location, but not allowing you to change it seems like a bit of an oversite.  

I am unfortuanltly not an android developer but i have done alot of C# and windows mobile development so I know there must be something like an App.Settings file that this could be stored in.

I am leaving on a big road trip in July so I don't have the time to leaner Android Development in the next 3 weeks but I dont see that either of these changes would be very hard for someone that knows what they are doing.

I really hope that someone can help with this.

Again thanks to the developers, perticularly like the ability to change the log interville by both time and distance.

Thanks

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Enable Move to External SD card option,[],"Enabling the option to move application to the external SD card could be very useful such as in those smartphones that have few MB of available internal memory.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,"""Nice to have"" features request","[Label(name=""discuss"")]","I love GPSLogger and its simplicity. I use GPSLogger for recording my tracks which I then use to edit the OpenStreetMap.

From my experience and usage I would like to share some thoughts on how to improve the usability:

**1)** At the end of a hike of over 10 km to find out that the track-recording has stopped somewhere along the path (when walking under a bridge or a dense passage in the forrest), is **really** annoying (mildly put).

So, when the GPS-signal is lost, recording should pause, but should continue, when the GPS-signal is available again, thus avoiding false recordings while inside a building or in an other area of bad or no GPS-signal-reception.

_This is my greatest problem at the moment and anything to prevent a false stop would be greatly appreciated._
BTW: I use a Samsung Google Nexus S.

I have read, that this might be in conjunction with using other GPS-apps at the same time. Well, when I hike I sometimes open OSMand to check the map. But I could not faithfully reproduce this bug.

**2)** When I record a track, I want to add waypoints so I can precisely remember where that roadcrossing was, or that landmark. Maybe the system could be made so intelligent to remember my last entries and present me with a dropdown-menu to choose from, so I don't have to type the word ""roadcrossing"" over and over again. ;-)

So, having a waypoint-button on the UI would be great. And right beneath it an input-field to type in some text or a button to record some audio or take a picture.

**3)** When I walk (and that implies a speed of roughly 3-6 km/h, then any trackpoints which are simply impossible (e.g. too far apart) should be ignored or somehow marked as ""not possible"". Also, when I am standing in one place the GPSLogger should be able to recognize that and stop recording 20 or more data-points which are wildly scattered around my location. It would be enough to record a new position only if it differs from the last one by a plausible distance.

So, some plausibility-checks would be a nice enhancement. This checks need not be performed while recording, but could be done after recording was stopped by the user. That would then be some sort of ""data clean-up"".

I admit, some thought has to be put into this, because how do you deal with the case of simply turning arround and backtrace your way that you just came? Or with riding a bike where you can vary your speed in a wide range? Tricky.

mendhak/gpslogger,closed,Issues with 1.1.2,"[Label(name=""discuss"")]","I've been lightly using GPSLogger since late 2010. Now I'm preparing for a trip and want to use the GPSLogger information to generate geotags for my photos.

In late December 2010 I used the then current version of GPSLogger to create a track in kml format and uploaded it to Google Maps. You can see it here: http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=200540836883352615011.000498bbd53ba084d72b6

Recently I used GPSLogger 1.1.2 to create several tracks (again in kml format) and uploaded them to Google Maps. You can see them here: http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=200540836883352615011.0004a615f3e78571819d0 and http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=200540836883352615011.0004a616081a10f43b884

I have several questions. First the two tracks created on 18 Jun 2011 both terminated on their own. By looking at where I was when the tracks terminated I wonder if perhaps I started GasBuddy at that time. GasBuddy uses the GPS to show stations near you.

Second the points in the recent tracks as displayed by Google Maps don't show the timestamps. This may be a difference in the way that Google Maps presents the data. The timestamps are visible in the file. I can send you the raw files if you need them.

I had a third question that I had posted over on http://gpslogger.codeplex.com/ but I can't recall it. Perhaps you can retrieve it from there.

Thanks for the GPSLogger app. Help me understand how I can make it more useful to me.

I'm running an un-rooted AT&T Captivate with FroYo.

However, if my location accuracy was set to 100m then the GPS would not need to be powered on for as long as it can get this level of accuracy from fewer satelites.
