I'm unsure how closely any of this mirrors stock Android. This is my only Android device so I'm completely unfamiliar with what the expected behaviors are.

By typing on a Bluetooth keyboard, then hitting Ctrl+A, I can use Revolution's own context menu rather than the Text Selection bar's one to select Format (I'm now realizing this is probably how people are expected to do formatting). The Text Selection bar is obscuring the top of Revolution such that I can't touch its context menu button while text is selected via touch. However, I can use it if I select text using a keyboard. However, this leads to my next issue:

When I select text with Shift and the cursor keys, the Format option doesn't appear in the context menu at all. This is an unusual enough use case that I wonder if it might even be an issue on stock Android. Seems like something that'd be worth testing with a Bluetooth keyboard, Android and Revolution on a more normal device.

Ideally, as soon as a nick is fully mentioned at the start of a message (with nick+colon), a check would be done to whether the user is currently in the channel, and as the message is being typed this check would be repeated periodically.

If at any time while typing, the other nick leaves or quits, give a strong visual warning; I suggest turning the text entry area red, if that's not too hard to implement.

Then the user could immediate stop wasting effort typing a message that the intended recipient will never see.

Now I am doing the mistake of `@TGuser` and when the user is also on IRC, I mention the IRC connection as RevolutionIRC stealthily removes the @ from the message.

I don't know how this should be implemented, my first though would be it being lesser evil of just having the @ visible for other users, but then I thought that it's likely that some clients ignore `@nick` being the same as `nick` and it would probably lead to complaints from users saying that everyone tells them that they don't need the @ in IRC."

Specifically, the server uses **TLSv1.2-ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384-256bits** encryption, so says the server status page. 

I don't really see any other IRC clients for Android supporting this-- it might be a good selling point of your client over others to allow for it, since SSL has had problems in the past and everyone will start moving towards this in the future of things as time goes on.

Please keep it up, as this is great!

My internet connection tends to reset periodically. When this happens while the app is connected to a network, it does not notice. It acts as if it was still connected for many hours, missing everything that's being said.

If there's no other way, pinging the server periodically would be the last resort to figure out if you're connected."

-> The channel opens, but the text box is not in focus, i.e. you can't type.

Like I said, this is not a biggie; but it requires you to raise your hand from the keyboard and manually touch the text box in order to activate the cursor. I had tried to hit ""tab"", and also the CTRL-L convention that browsers use in order to jump to the text/URL box, but those do not work.

My device is a Chromebook Plus (so with touch screen, which should give a similar experience as a large Android tablet with a keyboard, such as the Pixel C). I don't know how usable the client is on older Chromebooks that now have Android app support but no touchscreen.

   The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
   between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be
   sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
   too - they must not send any error reply back to the client on
   receipt of a notice.  The object of this rule is to avoid loops
   between a client automatically sending something in response to
   something it received.  This is typically used by automatons (clients
   with either an AI or other interactive program controlling their
   actions) which are always seen to be replying lest they end up in a
   loop with another automaton.

   See PRIVMSG for more details on replies and examples.
```

and I see this generally interpreted that NOTICE is a less important message than PRIVMSG while Revolution IRC appears to send a notification and also vibrates and plays the notification sound.

In spirit of the RFC, my bot is sending all messages as notices except messages it relays from other networks and [Matrix](https://matrix.org) has copied this behaviour and their [IRC bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc) causes all bot messages to appear as NOTICEs at IRC.

I think the easiest way to reproduce this on freenode is possibly to invite either `mijris[m]` or `ivar[m]` (Matrix bots) into any channel and saying `!ping` where they reply by saying `pong! <ISO8601 date>`. They accept all invites. (They also shouldn't rejoin after kicked.)"
MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,Username autocompletion errors,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","Usually I use the auto-complete feature a lot but the keyboard auto-correct dont like it. It keeps the typed letters without keeping the whole username. 
For example if I type ""Fox"" and I press the auto-complete it will write ""Foxlider"" but as soon as I press the spacebar key it will keep ""Fox"".
I think it's possible to correct it since AndChat's auto-complete works"

MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,Target Android O,"[Label(name=""enhancement""), Label(name=""low priority"")]","I'd really love to target Android O instead of N but the new notification channel system introduced in O has a fundamental flaw that makes it harder for this application to adapt it.
After creating a notification channel you can't change it in an way. To make things even worse, the channel is stored on the device forever and even if you delete and recreate it, it's settings will be restored. The recommended (and in fact, the only) way to change settings is to direct the user to the Settings app and let user manage the channel options there. But, you can't change the LED color or vibration pattern settings in that menu. The new Settings interface is way more annoying for the user, as currently the options are easily accessible under the notification options in the app and this would require adding an ugly link to go to settings to change those.

Solutions I can think of:
1. Wait for the next Android release, hope that it becomes more advanced (why do I doubt that...) and then make some sort of a broken Android O support workaround while properly supporting the next release.
2. Create a new unique notification channel every time the settings are changed. Con: we waste a small amount of storage each time.
3. Use the NotificationListenerService to edit the channels. Con: requires to be enabled manually by the user in settings, and can be suspicious as it gives the app full notification access."
MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,I might be doing something wrong?,[],"I've compiled the apk with Android Studio Preview.
It connects to znc 1.7.x but it stalls when you try to do something else.
Any idea?

MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,Easier switching between servers,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","As far as I can tell, when connected to multiple servers, the only way to switch between them or check for activity on the other ones is to open up the side panel. A gesture to switch servers or a button to quickly do so would be really nice (maybe lock open the side panel somehow?). My ideal interface would be something like a 'bar' of selectable servers next to the current server name (maybe even with activity indicators) but that seems like it'd be a lot more complicated.

This is also by far the best IRC client I've used on Android so far. Thank you for all the hard work you've put into it!"
MCMrARM/revolution-irc,closed,User modes aren't working,"[Label(name=""bug"")]","I gave some feedback on the Play store about this, but I figured I'd put this here as well - and give some details about further attempts.

Originally, I noticed I could not set user modes for myself (such as `+p`) using the `/mode` command. However, I'm also noticing that I can't set them with `/raw` either.

Typing in `/raw MODE Tynach +p` causes a thing to pop up saying that no such command was found, but it lets me 'send as raw'... After which the server pops this message back at me:

> ```421 Tynach raw :Unknown command```

I finally got it to work by making my own custom command alias, but I feel like this sort of thing should be built in. I poked around the code a bit and saw [CommandAliasManager.java][1], and am tempted to simply send a pull request with an additional `mode` line... But I feel like it'd be more intuitive to users if the two could be merged somehow.
