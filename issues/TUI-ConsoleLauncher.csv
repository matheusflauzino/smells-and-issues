Andre1299/TUI-ConsoleLauncher,open,"Notification longpress -> ""Exclude notification"" doesn't create filters that work.",[],"Notification longpress -> ""Exclude notification"" creates filters like: `<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncing… --- Title ""/>` and `<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>`. `%t` and `%pkg`  appear to be breaking the filter. Should they be replaced before the regex is checked? Or perhaps create a value string and in it replace `%t` with a time regex and `%pkg`/`%app' with the package/app name? I've replaced them with working regexes, but it took me a while to get to the issue.
```
<filter value=""Syncthing is running""/>
<!--<filter value=""Syncthing: Syncing…""/>-->
<filter value=""Syncthing is disabled""/>
```

The path to discovering the issue:

![screenshot_20180707-063811](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1442484/42573566-adf94084-84d9-11e8-9cf7-5d55c8fea023.png)
longpressing the notification and selecting ""Exclude notification"" put these in the notifications.xml file:
```
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncing… --- Title ""/>
...
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is disabled --- null""/>
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is disabled --- null""/>
```
but they weren't working. I cleaned up the extras, and found that if I comment out the ""Syncing… --- Title"" one then it appears to filter the notifications;
```
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>
<!--<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncing… --- Title ""/>-->
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is disabled --- null""/>
```

I also noticed that if I apply a non negative id and create an ""apply"", then it also starts filter these notifications:
```
<apply id=""3"" package=""com.nutomic.synthingandroid""/>
<filter id=""3"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>
<filter id=""3"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncing… --- Title ""/>
<filter id=""3"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is disabled --- null""/>
```

And by ""work"" i mean, they appear to be all or nothing. I can't get them to go one at a time. This also prevents all notifications.
```
<!--<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is running --- null""/>
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncing… --- Title ""/>-->
<filter id=""-1"" value=""[%t] %pkg: Syncthing is disabled --- null""/>
```

Looking at the documentation, apply isn't a thing anymore? I'll have to re-work some filters now. I tried limiting the ""value"" and that seems to work.
```
<filter value=""Syncthing is running""/>
<!--<filter value=""Syncthing: Syncing…""/>-->
<filter value=""Syncthing is disabled""/>

Andre1299/TUI-ConsoleLauncher,open,Not really usable with hardware keyboard (like Motorola Droid4/xt894),[],"Hi,

thx for great T-UI which is unfortunately not really usable with a hardware keyboar, example:

When I want to open ""settings"" I type `s` on my hardware keyboard.
Now there is no input possible anymore (no more hardware typing possible) and t-ui suggests ""ls"", to go on typing with hardware keyboard I have to tap one time on my display into command line.
Now I type `e` to complete ""settings"", input stops again and suggests ""search"" and ""ls"".
I have to tap again one time into command line to type `t` - now I can choose ""settings"".

So it would be nice if you could just type as much as you want and t-ui would suggest whatever fits but without any interruptions I've described. Possible?

PS: I've reported this before as part of https://github.com/Andre1299/TUI-ConsoleLauncher/issues/97 but this issues was closed today. After testing T-UI (F-Droid version) today again I noticed that it has the same behaviour using hardware keyboards as described above."

It's a longshot - but instead of replying only to last notification, is it possible to reply to the individual **chat** thread. Basically, the actual chat with the person that I **hold** and **reply**.

Basically remove the limitation of just able to reply to the last chat but allow to reply to any chat messages. The reason being is that often someone else sent me a message before I could hit enter and the message simply went to the wrong person. It's been fun.

i.e. 
01:56 PM - TUI >> WhatsApp > Andrew : How's it going?
01:58 PM - TUI >> WhatsApp > Bobby : What's for dinner?

Andre1299/TUI-ConsoleLauncher,closed,Switching user,[],"I am currently running TUI on a Nethunter installation and was pondering possible integration with the Kali shell.

There is a built in terminal (""Nethunter Terminal"") which enables selecting which shell to start (Android/Kali).
TUI currently shows the selected user as the default Android user, in my case:
user@hammerhead
This is the same user as selecting ""Android"" in the Nethunter terminal app.

After some decompiling and research of the app I noticed that it uses the following commands for shell switching (as per com.offsec.nhterm package):
Android shell (no root, same as TUI): sh -
Android shell (SU): su
Kali shell: su -c /system/bin/bootkali
Kali login shell:su -c /system/bin/bootkali_login

Manually entering the above commands through TUI fails to switch shells, and through the login shell it does not produce and output to commands (maybe it did switch but not supported?)

Is there an option to support the shell switching?"

Also, it seems by default it can even print some system notifications like the ""change keyboard"" notification, which isn't something I'd want it to appear.

So far I could only see ways to control notifications per app, globally or through regex (can be app-specific).

If the SD card has been configured as external storage, the SD card will be mounted in /storage/XXXX-XXXX, where XXXX-XXXX is the volume serial number if the SD card is formatted as FAT32 or exFAT, which is different among cards, and different values will be assigned whenever the card is reformatted, making manually setting a SECONDARY_STORAGE value in the system a bad idea.

Currently every new feature is being added in the main app and not everyone needs every feature.
Let's say for example if someone wants a feature like checking stock price of a particular stock with a command. It's not relevant for everyone but some people might need it.
So, it can be distributed as a separate app on Play Store and whoever needs that functionality can just install the plugin and that can appear in launcher. In the current feature set ""calc"" and ""music player"" can be moved out as plugins.

This functionality can be implemented using AIDL based plugin system where there is a common interface with basic types for communication between two apps.

Let me know if this sounds good. I'll create a PR for this.

Andre1299/TUI-ConsoleLauncher,closed,[Feature request] call specific number instead of first number found,[],"When I type `call <<contact_name>>`, a phone number is automatically chosen from the contact.
**I'd like to choose which number I call**, if there are multiple stored.

### Background:
For many contacts I have stored both a mobile phone and a home number. Most of the time I'd rather like to call the mobile number, but the home number is chosen automatically.

### Idea:
I'd like to specify which number to call. This could be done e.g. with `call <<contact_name>> mobile`. If this is not specified, but there are multiple numbers for a contact, list the numbers available, e.g.
```
<<contact_name>>:
    (1) home:   + XX XXXX XXXXXXX
    (2) mobile: + XX XXXX XXXXXXX
```
One could apply a counter and allow commands like `call <<contact_name>> 1` as well.

If this is possible by the architecture of the launcher, one could allow a two step command:
```
$ call <<contact_name>>
available numbers:
    (1) home:   + XX XXXX XXXXXXX
    (2) mobile: + XX XXXX XXXXXXX
$ 1
calling home
```

### Implementation:
If you think this is a good idea, I'd consider looking into the source myself and implementing this. I could use some pointers to get started, though.
I'd be happy if you could tell me what is easily possible from a design PoV (e.g. the two-step command)."
