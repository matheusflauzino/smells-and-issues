 IPython
=========

Tools for Interactive Computing in Python
=========================================

    A Python shell with automatic history (input and output), dynamic object
    introspection, easier configuration, command completion, access to the
    system shell and more.  IPython can also be embedded in running programs.

Usage

    ipython [subcommand] [options] [-c cmd | -m mod | file] [--] [arg] ...

    If invoked with no options, it executes the file and exits, passing the
    remaining arguments to the script, just as if you had specified the same
    command with python. You may need to specify `--` before args to be passed
    to the script, to prevent IPython from attempting to parse them. If you
    specify the option `-i` before the filename, it will enter an interactive
    IPython session after running the script, rather than exiting. Files ending
    in .py will be treated as normal Python, but files ending in .ipy can
    contain special IPython syntax (magic commands, shell expansions, etc.).

    Almost all configuration in IPython is available via the command-line. Do
    `ipython --help-all` to see all available options.  For persistent
    configuration, look into your `ipython_config.py` configuration file for
    details.

    This file is typically installed in the `IPYTHONDIR` directory, and there
    is a separate configuration directory for each profile. The default profile
    directory will be located in $IPYTHONDIR/profile_default. IPYTHONDIR
    defaults to to `$HOME/.ipython`.  For Windows users, $HOME resolves to
    C:\Users\YourUserName in most instances.

    To initialize a profile with the default configuration file, do::

      $> ipython profile create

    and start editing `IPYTHONDIR/profile_default/ipython_config.py`

    In IPython's documentation, we will refer to this directory as
    `IPYTHONDIR`, you can change its default location by creating an
    environment variable with this name and setting it to the desired path.

    For more information, see the manual available in HTML and PDF in your
    installation, or online at https://ipython.org/documentation.html.

Subcommands

Options
-------

Arguments that take values are actually convenience aliases to full
Configurables, whose aliases are listed on the help line. For more information
on full configurables, see '--help-all'.

--debug
    set log level to logging.DEBUG (maximize logging output)
--quiet
    set log level to logging.CRITICAL (minimize logging output)
--init
    Initialize profile with default config files.  This is equivalent
    to running `ipython profile create <profile>` prior to startup.
--autoindent
    Turn on autoindenting.
--no-autoindent
    Turn off autoindenting.
--automagic
    Turn on the auto calling of magic commands. Type %%magic at the
    IPython  prompt  for  more information.
--no-automagic
    Turn off the auto calling of magic commands.
--pdb
    Enable auto calling the pdb debugger after every exception.
--no-pdb
    Disable auto calling the pdb debugger after every exception.
--pprint
    Enable auto pretty printing of results.
--no-pprint
    Disable auto pretty printing of results.
--color-info
    IPython can display information about objects via a set of functions,
    and optionally can use colors for this, syntax highlighting
    source code and various other elements. This is on by default, but can cause
    problems with some pagers. If you see such problems, you can disable the
    colours.
--no-color-info
    Disable using colors for info related things.
--nosep
    Eliminate all spacing between prompts.
--pylab
    Pre-load matplotlib and numpy for interactive use with
    the default matplotlib backend.
--matplotlib
    Configure matplotlib for interactive use with
    the default matplotlib backend.
--autoedit-syntax
    Turn on auto editing of files with syntax errors.
--no-autoedit-syntax
    Turn off auto editing of files with syntax errors.
--simple-prompt
    Force simple minimal prompt using `raw_input`
--no-simple-prompt
    Use a rich interactive prompt with prompt_toolkit
--banner
    Display a banner upon starting IPython.
--no-banner
    Don't display a banner upon starting IPython.
--confirm-exit
    Set to confirm when you try to exit IPython with an EOF (Control-D
    in Unix, Control-Z/Enter in Windows). By typing 'exit' or 'quit',
    you can force a direct exit without any confirmation.
--no-confirm-exit
    Don't prompt the user when exiting.
--term-title
    Enable auto setting the terminal title.
--no-term-title
    Disable auto setting the terminal title.
--classic
    Gives IPython a similar feel to the classic Python prompt.
--quick
    Enable quick startup with no config files.
-i
    If running code from the command line, become interactive afterwards.
    It is often useful to follow this with `--` to treat remaining flags as
    script arguments.
--profile-dir=<Unicode> (ProfileDir.location)
    Default: ''
    Set the profile location directly. This overrides the logic used by the
    `profile` option.
--profile=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.profile)
    Default: 'default'
    The IPython profile to use.
--ipython-dir=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.ipython_dir)
    Default: ''
    The name of the IPython directory. This directory is used for logging
    configuration (through profiles), history storage, etc. The default is
    usually $HOME/.ipython. This option can also be specified through the
    environment variable IPYTHONDIR.
--log-level=<Enum> (Application.log_level)
    Default: 30
    Choices: (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL')
    Set the log level by value or name.
--config=<Unicode> (BaseIPythonApplication.extra_config_file)
    Default: ''
    Path to an extra config file to load.
    If specified, load this config file in addition to any other IPython config.
--autocall=<Enum> (InteractiveShell.autocall)
    Default: 0
    Choices: (0, 1, 2)
    Make IPython automatically call any callable object even if you didn't type
    explicit parentheses. For example, 'str 43' becomes 'str(43)' automatically.
    The value can be '0' to disable the feature, '1' for 'smart' autocall, where
    it is not applied if there are no more arguments on the line, and '2' for
    'full' autocall, where all callable objects are automatically called (even
    if no arguments are present).
--colors=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShell.colors)

    log file to **overwrite** logs to.
-c <Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.code_to_run)
    Default: ''
    Execute the given command string.
-m <Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.module_to_run)
    Default: ''
    Run the module as a script.
--ext=<Unicode> (InteractiveShellApp.extra_extension)
    Default: ''
    dotted module name of an IPython extension to load.
--gui=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.gui)
    Default: None
    Choices: ['glut', 'gtk', 'gtk2', 'gtk3', 'osx', 'pyglet', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'tk', 'wx', 'gtk2', 'qt4']
    Enable GUI event loop integration with any of ('glut', 'gtk', 'gtk2',
    'gtk3', 'osx', 'pyglet', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'tk', 'wx', 'gtk2', 'qt4').
--pylab=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.pylab)
    Default: None
    Choices: ['auto', 'agg', 'gtk', 'gtk3', 'inline', 'ipympl', 'nbagg', 'notebook', 'osx', 'pdf', 'ps', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'svg', 'tk', 'widget', 'wx']
    Pre-load matplotlib and numpy for interactive use, selecting a particular
    matplotlib backend and loop integration.

    Default: None
    Choices: ['auto', 'agg', 'gtk', 'gtk3', 'inline', 'ipympl', 'nbagg', 'notebook', 'osx', 'pdf', 'ps', 'qt', 'qt4', 'qt5', 'svg', 'tk', 'widget', 'wx']
    Configure matplotlib for interactive use with the default matplotlib
    backend.
--cache-size=<Int> (InteractiveShell.cache_size)
    Default: 1000
    Set the size of the output cache.  The default is 1000, you can change it
    permanently in your config file.  Setting it to 0 completely disables the
    caching system, and the minimum value accepted is 3 (if you provide a value
    less than 3, it is reset to 0 and a warning is issued).  This limit is
    defined because otherwise you'll spend more time re-flushing a too small
    cache than working

To see all available configurables, use `--help-all`

Examples
--------

    ipython --matplotlib       # enable matplotlib integration
    ipython --matplotlib=qt    # enable matplotlib integration with qt4 backend

    ipython --log-level=DEBUG  # set logging to DEBUG
    ipython --profile=foo      # start with profile foo

    ipython profile create foo # create profile foo w/ default config files
    ipython help profile       # show the help for the profile subcmd

    ipython locate             # print the path to the IPython directory
    ipython locate profile foo # print the path to the directory for profile `foo`

```
which, in my opinion, is a little hackey... There are a lot of things that could stop this script, like the screen being locked or a Termux session already being open with text typed in.

I propose that a new Activity/Service is added (or an extension of `com.termux/.app.TermuxService` to allow use by ADB). You could possibly even allow another app (with user granted permission) to run a command!

This would be BEYOND useful (and a little cool, too), like being able to start up `sshd` and setup port forwarding completely from the computer! You wouldn't even have to unlock the screen, assuming that you have already accepted the computer's RSA Fingerprint on your phone.

One example for all: the ""ARROW_UP"" button will fill in previous command, this obstructs the new command you are about to type in the text input view.

And if it would be possible to share folder between Proot and Termux environment, may be, that speech-dispatcher could communicate with Pulseaudio by using Unix sockets. Perhaps, those sockets are much more faster, than Inet sockets.

I Am wondering, why is it not possible to allow users to access external storage from Termux at least when creating new Chroot container by using Proot.
I Am aware, that SD card is not so fast like build in chips which are The internal part of every Android device. I also know, that there is no USB HUB, which can power external harddisk and power also connected Android device at The same time. Unfortunately, this HUB donot exist thanks to strange facts.
But why Termux do not allow users to store or access data from external SD card? Or from external harddisk?
Could this make system unstable?
I AM aware, that Android 7.0 and newer do not allow users to store application package to external SD card. And even Android 6.0 allowed this, applications data have been stored in The internal device storage, if application programmer did not make his app so all data were really stored to SD card.
But I think, that developer have freedom to store application data to SD card. If not all, at least big files would be stored on externalSD card.

Here's a brief overview:
- `\e[4:1m` straight underline
- `\e[4:2m` double underline
- `\e[4:3m` curly underline

**Note**: the colon is strictly required, as something like `\e[4;1mHello\e[0m` would print a bold, underlined ""Hello"" to the console. This is discussed in the [neovim issue](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7479#issuecomment-348783792).

Support for this was added to neovim in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/7479, and in tmux (so far without color support) in https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1492. There's an idea floating around that the underline can be given a color using `58:2:<r>:<g>:<b>` or `58:5:<x11 color>`, similar to how it's done for true colors. From what I've read, `CSI 59` resets the underline color. (I'm not a terminal developer, so please forgive me if I'm butchering these terms).

termux/termux-app,closed,How to connect Quoda Text Editor with Termux ?,[],"As we know that Termux is the greatest terminal app for Android, I was using it for making NodeJS projects. Now I need to use the Termux App-Private folder as the project directory. But I can't access that folder through my Text Editor (Quoda Android App). Using vim or nano is an absolute no as it has no programing related tools and it is very hard to make huge NodeJS projects vim/nano. Quoda has ftp client feature but It can't connect anonymously to any ftp server and I can't start Termux ftp server using Access control either. Quoda has FTP, FTPS, FTPES, SFTP client features but it forces me to enter username and password. How could I connect Quoda Text Editor with Termux App-Private folder ?

termux/termux-app,open,dpkg for Termux doesn't correctly supports x86-64 Android devices - x86_64 vs x86-64 vs amd64 name of architecture for packages and repo paths dispute,[],"I usually install Termux on my `x86_64` devices (more often on Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML Z00A/Z00AD) from Google Play or F-Droid and by default repos in `APT` (`/etc/apt/sources.list`) and architectures in `dpkg` (`/var/lib/dpkg/arch`) configured to support packages only of i686 architecture, but Intel Atom Z3580 CPU in my device supports `x86_64`, `i686` and `arm (ARMv7)` archs well.
And I can not change this behaviour of Termux - `dpkg` doesn't allow to add architecture through `dpkg --add-architecture x86_64`, 'cause character `'_'` in `x86_64` not allowed by `dpkg`, but packages repo (http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64, http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease, http://termux.net/dists/stable/Release) configured exactly with underscore (`'_'`) characters everywhere.
Certainly, I manually install `http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64/dpkg_1.19.0.5_x86_64.deb` and `http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-x86_64/liblzma_5.2.4_x86_64.deb` with `dpkg -i --force-all *.deb`, change repos in `APT` and archs in `dpkg` configurations, but whatever I do - this doesn't helps and correct this situation.
So, unfortunately, I cannot install `x86_64` packages, but this relates not only me and has more wide impact, 'cause app doesn't support `x86_64` devices well enough.

More specifically, TAB just inserts a TAB character rather than displaying completions, `C-a` inserts a character of ASCII code 1 (displayed as `^A`), ...

Along the same lines, after hitting RET to send the command, the command is echoed back before the actual command's output.  I tried `tsu`, but it suffers from the same problem.

One odd detail I noticed along the way is that while `tty` responds `/dev/pts/0` when I'm not within `su`, it switches to `/dev/pts/1` when I'm in `su`.

These problems do not affect `su` in `adb shell`, so apparently there's some way to ""make it work right"".

I don't have root (and never has had on this phone). 

Snippets of ls reveals that _everybody_ lacks the write permission for the sdcard.

Not sure if it matters but I the sdcard was previously (in android 7) mounted at
/storage/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (which I thought was weird)
whereas in Android 8 it is
/storage/30303030-2d30-3030-3000-020000000000

All other applications that I use can still access and create files on the sdcard as ususal (and not just their own _Android/data_ directory). I've ran termux-setup-storage again and although it fixed the symlinks to the new sdcard mount it didn't do anything for the permissions. Also tried to reinstall termux but the behavior is the same.

But that works only for android 5? I didn't notice any big difference when I merged it (https://github.com/Grimler91/termux-app/tree/configurable_keys_smaller)

Also, more importantly, **we/I need to add more validation of the `extrakeys` field!** If, for example, two rows of different lengths are given the app crashes on start-up (with no change of fail-safe session).

--------------------

I've also set the default extra keys to default to the single row we had before, and made the extra keys visible per default. Users who want several rows can configure it.

We should definitely ship a default termux.properties file with all the different options as comments, they are a bit secret as mentioned in the previous PR.

Any Solution to fix this?"
termux/termux-app,open,Android new session widget bug,[],If you open a new session with this widget the background color turns black (resets)
termux/termux-app,closed,mv doesn't work outside of /home inside proot,[],"If I am inside a proot chroot, I get the following
```
bash-4.4$ pwd
/home
bash-4.4$ touch a
bash-4.4$ mv a b
#If CWD is /home it works, however anywhere else:
bash-4.4$ mkdir test
bash-4.4$ cd test
bash-4.4$ touch a
bash-4.4$ mv a b
mv: cannot move 'a' to 'b': No such file or directory
```

If I am not using proot if works fine.

Running proot as below:
```
exec /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/proot -b /system:/system -b /vendor:/vendor -b /data:/data -b /property_contexts:/property_contexts -b /storage:/storage -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr:/usr -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin:/bin -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc:/etc -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib:/lib -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share:/share -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp:/tmp -b /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var:/var -b /dev:/dev -b /proc:/proc --cwd=/home -r /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/.. /bin/bash -l
```

EDIT:  A couple more things I noticed.

1. If b exists, it works
```
bash-4.4$ mkdir test
bash-4.4$ cd test
bash-4.4$ touch a
bash-4.4$ mv a b
mv: cannot move 'a' to 'b': No such file or directory
bash-4.4$ touch b
bash-4.4$ mv a b
bash-4.4$ ls
b
```

2. The location of the file does not matter, only CWD.
```
bash-4.4$ mkdir test
bash-4.4$ cd test
bash-4.4$ touch ../a
bash-4.4$ mv ../a ../b
mv: cannot move '../a' to '../b': No such file or directory
bash-4.4$ cd ..
bash-4.4$ touch test/a
bash-4.4$ mv test/a test/b
bash-4.4$ ls test
b

termux/termux-app,open,Persistent Home Directory,[],"What I'm looking for is a nice, convenient way to store configuration settings for externally running applications in Termux. For example, when I install Midnight Commander (mc) or `pip install youtube-dl` or edit my `~/.vimrc` or `~/.bashrc`, etc... I would like my settings to still exist even when I remove Termux, even by accident (somehow).

Let's say, I give Termux storage permissions (now possible starting with Nougat). So then, somewhere in `/sdcard/` directory, I should then be able to make a directory where I can store dotfiles and settings for applications, like a ""second home folder"" if you will.

Is it as simple as using a home directory symlink, or appending something to $PATH, or is this more complex?

Something more of a streamlined solution would be great to add to Termux!"

termux/termux-app,closed,Wrong timezone in Go,[],"I'm running [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) on my Nexus 5 via Termux (thank you, by the way, for this amazing contribution to humanity) and when I changed the datestamp on a post manually to the current time, I noticed that Hugo did not build my post because it thought the time was in the future. That's when I realised that it had written the date stamp with a timezone of Z while creating the post instead of +01:00 (I'm on Irish Standard Time at the moment).

## Context

  * Time and timezone on the phone is set and displayed correctly
  * In a Termux session, `date` produces the right time and date and timezone (IST)
  * getprop persist.sys.timezone produces the correct timezone (Europe/Dublin)

## To replicate

The following basic Go app produces the wrong timezone consistently for me both under plain Termux and under termux-chroot:

```go
package main

import ""time""
import ""fmt""

func main() {
  p := fmt.Println
  t := time.Now()
  p(t.Format(time.RFC3339))
}
```

## Sample output

```bash
date
Wed Jul  4 16:48:28 IST 2018

getprop persist.sys.timezone
Europe/Dublin

go run time.go
2018-07-04T15:48:37Z
```

So Go thinks its on UTC even though we're on IST.

## Update

I’ve just verified on my Mac that this is erroneous behaviour in Termux and not an anomaly specific to Go. The output of the same script and the corresponding `date` results are in the screenshot below: 

<img width=""731"" alt=""screen shot 2018-07-04 at 17 28 38"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41798/42287790-b82edb06-7faf-11e8-8365-9f90b5dbbe30.png"">

## Update 2

As a further check, the issue does not exist in Node.js under a Termux session. The following code:

```javascript
let t = new Date().toTimeString()
console.log(t)
```

Produces:

```bash
17:38:36 GMT +0100 (IST)
```"

termux/termux-app,closed,Add permission WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE,[],"`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` provides write access to emulated SD card (""internal storage""). However for some reason it provides only read access to real SD card. This is what happen before and after `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is granted respectively on my phone:

```
$ id
uid=10312(u0_a312) gid=10312(u0_a312) groups=10312(u0_a312),3003(inet),9997(everybody),20312(u0_a312_cache),50312(all_a312)
$ ls -ld /storage/emulated/0
drwxrwx--x 87 root sdcard_rw 4096 Jul  2 15:17 /storage/emulated/0
$ ls -ld /storage/3436-3531
drwxrwx--x 5 root sdcard_rw 32768 Jan  1  1970 /storage/3436-3531
```

```
$ id
uid=10312(u0_a312) gid=10312(u0_a312) groups=10312(u0_a312),3003(inet),9997(everybody),20312(u0_a312_cache),50312(all_a312)

drwxr-xr-x 5 root everybody 32768 Jan  1  1970 /storage/3436-3531
```

As you can see, although both storage paths' owner group changes from `sdcard_rw` to `everybody` after the permission is granted, the group permission of that of the real SD card changes from `rwx` to `r-x`.

From the data/etc/platform.xml in current platform/frameworks/base master, I can see that the group `sdcard_rw` (along side with `media_rw`) is provided by an undocumented permission named `WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE`. Therefore, proposing to add the permission to the manifest.

P.S. Not tested so I have no idea if it actually works as expected. Would be great if someone at liberty to build the app can help test this."

termux already converts up/down swipes into mouse wheel events, so you can scroll. In `vim`, these can be mapped like:

```
  map <ScrollWheelUp> <C-Y>
  map <ScrollWheelDown> <C-E>
```

But `vim` can also accept horizontal mouse wheel events:

```
  map <ScrollWheelLeft> z<Left>
  map <ScrollWheelRight> z<Right>
```

But termux doesn't seem to be generating them.

This seems like it would be simple to add, and it wouldn't interfere with the swipe from the left to bring up the window list and keyboard/new session, because that starts from the edge of the display.

in termux and checking CPU usage in a second termux session with top and 1 shows that only one CPU is used for this task. The same command in a linux-pc console will use multiple cores.

This task takes about 6min on my phone for a single Image to finish. I don`t know if this is Android, command-specific (imagemagick`s identify -version gives me no OpenMP) or termux related.
To speed things up i just wanted to ask in genell ""if termux is capable of using multiple CPU cores for a task""? or is there an option like in make with 
`make -j4`

termux/termux-app,open,"[Feature Request] arrow keys, CTRL, ALT, ESC, exit terminal, font colour, etc.",[],"Hi, I have been using Termux for quite a while on my Android & must say that its my favourite terminal emulator for Android.... There's an SSH app I use called JuiceSSH which gave me this idea, plus when a command doesn't execute properly & it hangs I cannot stop the hanging, nor can I even make termux exit, which forces me to reboot my phone because termux creates a notification that I can't make close...
I have to type exit in order to get termux to exit, that's not good, perhaps you guys could make it so we can close the app from outside of the app?? A feature to change the text colour would also be cool, it would be easier to read the text if it were bright-ish green on a black background for example.
arrow keys would also be a huge help, that way we can cycle through previous commands, its kind of annoying having to re-type the same command on a touch-screen.

termux/termux-app,open,chromeos: better support for using terminal mouse events AND selection/copy?,[],"I use Termux (latest available in Play Store) on ChromeOS (66.0.3359.203 on an Asus C301S) and run a number of console programs that can accept terminal mouse input (emacs, weechat, tmux). When a console program accepts mouse input, Termux passes the mouse events through and it works nicely, but at the same time, it disables the long-press to open the selection menu. Thus, my choice is to use terminal mouse events XOR to be able to copy text from Termux to ChromeOS. (Note: paste from ChromeOS to Termux is unaffected, b/c the hardware keyboard Ctrl+Alt+V allows it to work.)

I have currently handled this by explicitly disabling terminal mouse events in my Termux dotfiles. However, this is suboptimal because it represents a (currently the only) difference between my regular Linux dotfiles and Termux dotfiles, and using the mouse in console programs is occasionally useful. If I can get a way of using terminal mouse events AND copying text from Termux to ChromeOS, then I can use a single set of dotfiles for both environments.

I'm thinking of two alternative ways to solve this:

1. A new hardware keyboard shortcut to activate the selection menu. This would probably be the easiest, but I'd rather avoid making more Termux shortcuts that might conflict with peoples' existing keybindings.

2. Provide a way to switch from the regular popup menu (activated by keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+M) to the selection menu. You can currently switch from the selection menu to the regular popup menu by clicking the ""More..."" button; perhaps there could be a ""Selection..."" button to switch from the regular popup menu to the selection menu?

Another alternative that I'm guessing would be more complex to implement:

3. Gnome Terminal has a similar issue that terminal apps accepting mouse events disables its built-in mouse actions. With Gnome Terminal, when you hold the Shift key, mouse events are handled directly by Gnome Terminal and not passed through to the app running in the terminal.

Any thoughts or ideas?"

termux/termux-app,open,Alt-V volume keybinding interferes with readline,[],"Firstly, thanks for this amazing project.  I use it all the time.

One quirk I noticed... while Ctl-V (volume down - V) works beautifully for page-down, alt-v (for page up) does not and instead loads volume control.
While I understand need to access volume, one can easily navigate to diff android app to adjust volume, but having the volume up key more consistent with alt or meta key would I think be most important. 

This is more than just with Alt-V (paging up in emacs / less / etc), but with Alt-D as well  (delete following word)
Here's a cheat-sheet with bindings: http://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html

I'm happy to try to submit a PR, but since this would change existing behavior, wanted to file an issue.

TL;DR I respectfully suggest that Volume Up key acts more consistently as Alt (or meta key) for better readline support

(I can't tell whether there might be better ways than using webkit's mimetypemap (maybe libmagic?) -- but lowercasing would mitigate the immediate issue).

I tried running `file usr/lib/libmp3lame.so`, and output is
`usr/lib/libmp3lame.so: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped`

termux/termux-app,open,Add hundreds of downloadable fonts to termux (discussion),[],"So I modded the [Termux-Styling](https://github.com/termux/termux-styling) app to support android's new [downloadable font](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/downloadable-fonts) feature, but I ran into two issues that need resolving:

*  Downloadable fonts requires a valid font provider.  The most popular one is Google Play, but that means that Google Play is required to be installed to get access to them.  No big deal, can fallback to the current bundled fonts if it's not installed.

*  The thing is though, when you request one of the downloadable fonts, you're handed a [TypeFace](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface) object, NOT a .ttf file, which is what the Styling app currently needs to save for the Termux app to use.   You can easily [go from a font file to a TypeFace object](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html#createFromFile(java.io.File)), but not vice versa.  So while I can currently get the Typeface in the styling app, there's not much I can do with it.

There is another option, which is to use Google's font API to get the actual URI to the .ttf file for the font, and then use the Termux Styling app to download that file and copy it into the right place.  This wouldn't require modifying anything in Termux app, but it would require entering a ([freely available](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey)) API key to be able to access that and that might be too annoying to add this.  Might also as a FOURTH option make a list of all the .ttf paths but that may change in the future.

The question-- would it make more sense to just add the downloadable font support to the termux app itself?  It would barely add any size to the app footprint (in fact could make it smaller if you're not loading all those unused fonts in Styling) and fonts are cached by Google Play and reused between apps.  Downside would be that (1) this doesn't affect color stuff, (2) it does have the Google Play dependency and so wouldn't add much for FDroid users, and (3) I am unclear as to whether then you move the color support into termux app or keep the styling or what.

Just throwing it out there if anyone wants to offer any thoughts or opinions."

termux/termux-app,open,TIOCGWINSZ reports zero window rows/cols until screen is rotated,[],"Ok finally figured out why mosh was sometimes having issues from within my chroot in termux: when termux is first opened, it will report the window size as 0 rows and 0 columns, but if the screen is rotated while termux is open, it will then report the correct rows and columns from that point forward.

This python script can be used to test this:
```
import sys, struct, fcntl, termios
s = struct.pack('HHHH', 0, 0, 0, 0)
t = fcntl.ioctl(sys.stdout.fileno(), termios.TIOCGWINSZ, s)
print(struct.unpack('HHHH', t))
```

Before the screen is rotated, it will output `(0,0,0,0)`, but after it's rotated, it will output something like `(26,96,0,0)`."

termux/termux-app,open,"""Storage"" permission not available in app settings",[],"Hi. I am trying to have write access to an external USB drive from Termux with no success.
From what I have learned, the process should be: run termux-setup-storage, and allow the permission when the pop-up shows up. I have done that multiple times, and the ""storage"" directory is created, but it doesn't contain the symlink to ""external"". If I run ""df"", I can see how the USB disk is already mounted in /storage (read only), but, as I say, the symlink is not created.

After checking, I noticed that, in the Termux settings page, under ""Permissions"", there is no Storage permission available for enabling or disabling, only a ""Memory"" permission, which is already enabled. Could this be the reason of ""$HOME/storage/external"" not being created?. If so, is there any way to make the Storage permission appear?, or is this a bug?

Thanks and keep up the good work."

> [https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/6](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/6) Would the app itself (without many packages) be interesting in itself for older versions, running just as a terminal emulator?

Yes, this would be great!

I recently started to use Termux. And I find it very interesting. For years I have used other Linux-on-Android systems; but I think this project is superior: simple and effective.

After this short intro I propose a new idea around the “su” and “sudo” commands. Please, note that this isn’t a request of “how to use root in Termux” or “scripts for sudo”. I know about such tools, and this is a _different_ proposal:

- The problem: If you grant the root permission to Termux, then _any_ script running inside it can obtain root privileges (very bad!).

- The solution: Create a new Termux Add-on, called Termux:Sudo. This addon will be another _different_ Android App. This new application will have an structure similar to Termux:API, so it can communicate with the Termux shell environment. But this new app focuses on running processes with elevated privileges. In consequence, this Termux:Sudo is the _only_ app that needs to receive the root privileges.

- The implementation: The new Termux:Sudo will maintain an internal password for root (obfuscated) and a list of grant commands (or ‘*’ for all). So the function is very similar to the “sudo” command, and configured in the same way. Note that the data of Termux:Sudo App is _inaccessible_ from the Termux environment, so the password and configuration is even secure.

- The use: When you call for example “sudo nano /system/build.prop” a password command is presented prior to execute the binary.

What you think about this idea?

An example is termux-open. If, again within Emacs, I launch the command with 'bash termux-open"" I get an error 127. A few things work, like termux-info.

I tried to find the point of failure in ""am"" and I /think/ but cannot be certain or verify that the problem occurs when ""am"" reads arguments.

termux/termux-app,closed,Terminal output speed issues,[],"This is probably the same as #218 and #368, but I felt that they might not describe the problem adequately.

Terminal output is too slow on many different occasions. When Termux cannot keep up with produced output, it stutters at best and becomes unresponsive for minutes at worst. As far as I can tell, using ANSI escapes (for colors, ncurses ui, etc.) makes things even worse.

Most typical manifestations in my experience:
* Scrolling in `less` and similar utilities. Scrolling down is fine, scronling up redraws whole screen and lags like hell.
* Build logs. Use minimal verbosity and you should be fine. Up verbosity a bit or get a lot of warnings due to a typo in a header, and your terminal is busted. Screen updates once every few seconds, and you'll be catching up with an already finished build for many minutes. (I usually just kill Termux and reconnect to my `tmux` session.)

This has been happening for a long while, half a year at very least. However, after one of the most recent updates (noticed on 0.60), the problem got *much* worse. On my Samsung tablet running Android 5.1.1, 80x25 terminal is mostly bearable, while on 190x40 `vim` takes _almost a minute_ to start and regularly hangs for a few seconds (e.g. on newline entry). Not nearly as bad on my phone running 6.0.1, but still noticeable. 

I haven't yet looked at source code (don't have time right now, neither do I have Android app development experience), but I intend to unless it's fixed in a week or two. I suspect excessive syncing among pty and UI threads and maybe inefficient scrollback handling."

require a separate try block for a separate logcat message, or a

Non-character keys are actually handled as expected, but immediate visual response only represents the related escape sequence - it's difficult, when not impossible, to take advantage of auto-completion, history and such. This happens in Termux with both `su` and `tsu` scripts and is keyboard-independent; root shells behave correctly in other terminal apps and over adb.

I'm trying to launch an external activity from within termux while giving it the ability to write to a file (or, if possible, a FIFO).

It would appear that TermuxOpenReceiver can almost handle my needs, except that it is currently only designed to handle read-only access.  Having the ability to edit files from other apps would be very useful for me.

I would therefore kindly request that TermuxOpenReceiver handle `ACTION_EDIT`, in which case it would add the flag `Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION` as well as open the file descriptor using `ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_WRITE`.  (Perhaps it is also necessary to add an `android:writePermission` attribute to the `<provider>` tag in AndroidManifest.xml?)

Finally, it is currently restricted to files only due to an `isFile()` check.  Could it be changed to `exists()` instead?  I'm hoping that I could get it to work with a named pipe rather than a regular file so that I could pipe data from the activity back to the terminal."

This makes termux much more accessible when users use non-specialized on-screen keyboards.

If users connect to a bluetooth/usb keyboard, the on-screen keyboard is hidden but the extra row is still being displayed and wastes screen space. While users could of course switch the row with special keys off by long-pressing on the ""keyboard"" button, I think this is unnecessarily cumbersome.

I would like to suggest to implement either one of the following changes:

1. Hide the row, when the on-screen keyboard is hidden.
2. Hide the row, when a hardware keyboard (bluetooth or usb) is being used.

termux/termux-app,open,arm build of bash does not handle keys correctly with TERM=xterm,[],"I am running termux on two different phones, one being aarch64 and the other being arm:

If I use putty with xterm settings and connect to the phones and press pos1, both receive the same keycodes (sh will print the same output for the key). However for some reason the arm build of bash produces a ~ instead of going to the beginning of the current input line. The end key shows the same behaviour. Also While F1-F12 show the same output in sh on both system, the output produced for some keys in bash is different.
Term variable is correctly identified as ""xterm"" on both system and stty shows the same settings.
Is there any setting I've missed or is this really a bug in the arm build of bash?"

I noticed that when starting sshd and then exiting Termux, one can still acess the sshd server. Now it's normal given that it's a daemon and it should be running, but I still wanted to open a ticket for two main reasons:
- If it's not the desired behavior and it is a bug, then probably add it to the pending list.
- If it's not a bug, maybe reconsider the pros and cons of such policy, because particularly for SSHd and no _fail2ban-like_ system, it could pose a threat to the user if the sshd server is always running. 

Anyway, thanks for the amazing work ladies and gentlemen."

"
termux/termux-app,closed,Ansi sequence for clicks sometime out of range,"[Label(name=""bug report"")]","Hi!

I noticed that the ANSI escape sequences that Termux send to applications that corresponds to clicks sometimes are out of range. This happens when clicking between the display and the keyboard. This has the unfortunate consequence that it confuses applications like Emacs.

Background:

When touching the Termux screen, the following escape sequence is emitted:

    ESC [ < 0 ; COL ; LINE M ESC [ < 0 ; COL ; LINE m

Where COL and LINE represent the column and the line if the click, encoded as ascii strings.

When clicking on the first line, the LINE is ""1"". When clicking on the last line of, say, a display ten lines high, it is ""10"".

The problem occurs if you tap the screen a little bit below the display, but above the keyboard. Then LINE will be ""11"", which is out of range. This, unfortunately, triggers Emacs into believing that you clicked on the menu bar.

I haven't checked if the same problem exists for COL, but presumably it does.

If you want to check the escape sequences that Termux emits, you can start Emacs. Click on various locations and then type C-h l (which runs the command `view-lossage`). You will also note that if you tap very low on the screen, the text ""Menu Bar (up/down ..."" appears in the minibuffer, which it shouldn't.

This doesn't appear to be a problem when the keyboard is hidden.

termux/termux-app,closed,Optionally disable font change on pinch zoom gesture,[],"Among many other usages Termux is excellent for reading manpages or browsing the source code using vim. For this purpose I get rid of the onscreen keyboard and use a finger to scroll the text up. However, sometimes for some unknown reason the movement of the finger is interpreted as ""pinch zoom"" gesture and the font size is increased or decreased. This is very annoying as one has to bring it back to how it was and it is never exactly that, the difference in font sizes causing eye strain (this is the same reason, btw, why you can't use ""auto-crop margins"" function in a pdf/djvu document reader if your book has stuff in the margins, because then the font size of text will change from page to page and your eyes will become tired very quickly).

So, if there was a way to disable ""pinch zoom"" i.e. ignore such gestures in Termux, it would be very useful. Then, such ""misinterpreted scroll up attempt"" would simply be ignored and one would have to scroll it again, without having to pinch-resize the screen. Thank you."

termux/termux-app,open,Convert text navigation gestures into arrow key inputs,[],"The Blackberry PRIV and KEYone have gesture capable physical keyboards that allow the moving of the text cursor in standard text inputs, in a mode known as ""fine cursor control"". It would be great to translate these smoothly into arrow key inputs, to allow fast bash history scrollback, and cursor navigation in programs like vim.

Currently, the ""Up"" and ""Down"" gestures already trigger the up and down arrow keys in Termux, but not in a smooth or predictable manner. The left and right gestures currently do nothing.

It's likely that this support would also cover software keyboards that allow cursor movement through built in controls and gestures.

The Blackberry Captivate Keyboard Integration Guide is [here](https://community.blackberry.com/docs/DOC-10328), however it mainly relates to using the keyboard as a trackpad/scroll wheel, which isn't the case when the keyboard is in text input mode (like it always is in termux).

Snap, crackle, pop, until you *force stop*. No other way to stop it. Termux freezes, so you can't Ctrl+C, hit Exit on the notification, or swipe away.
Need I say more?

Ideas:
* Have a minimum delay between bells, probably 25 ms (half vibration time) at the least. This will fix the crackling from the Vibrator trying to activate before it is ""ready"". If we get any bell signals during that delay, we will wait until that delay is over, then beep/vibrate once:
``` 
Signals: bell bell bell bell bell bell bell bell bell
Output:  bell                bell                bell
Signals: bell     bell     
Output:  bell                bell
Signals: bell                           bell
Output:  bell                           bell
```
* Don't block the thread so the user can Ctrl+C it. This stupidity in the Android OS seems relevant; as it seems that Termux is attempting to run the bell on a separate thread.
> ""Like many callbacks from the system, the methods on this class are called from the main thread of your process."" — [ServiceConnection documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ServiceConnection.html)
* If spamming is detected, perhaps give a Snackbar saying something like ""A command is repeatedly using the bell."" with an option to temporarily silence it."

The capability gets set and hence it should work as I am running kernel that supports capabilities. However after restarting the `sshd` process it fails to run without any error message - obviously it won't boot because of the port change (I've tried ports 22, 555). It will start just fine when I return to `Port 8022` in `sshd_config`. I also tried this with SELinux in `Permissive` mode just in case.

I am trying to use termux on a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4"" with 16GB internal and 64GB external storage. Tablet is running LineageOS 13.0 (aka Android 6.0.1). Further, I am using nmilosevic's recipe for installing Fedora 25 and 26 under Termux. The problem I am running into relates to Google's inexplicable lack of support for ext4 on external SD cards and the two options I see for using an external SD card with Termux:

1) If I use my external SD card in ""adopted storage"" mode, Android formats it as ext4 (good), but then I can't move the Termux application to it. Further, termux-setup-storage does not recognize or make links to the external SD card. (In fact, of my ""linuxy"" apps, only XServer SDL, AndSMB and Hacker's Keyboard appear to be movable, pretty much - for me - defeating the purpose of the external SD card.) I run out of space on the internal SD card fairly quickly, with lots of space wasted on the external SD card.

2) If I use my external SD card in ""portable storage"" mode, then termux-setup-storage creates links to the external SD card (under /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage) but since Android formats this as some ridiculous FAT variant (bad), it is useless for installing Fedora onto or for building any of the Linux software that I have written, which exploits/requires UNIX file system permissions.

Consequently, I request that you add the capability of moving the Termux application to external ""adopted"" storage. By the way, I don't really care that Android thinks my external SD card is ""slow"" compared to the built-in memory. I can live with slow better than I can live with lack of function.

Your Termux application is - by far - the best Linux under Android solution that I have seen. Unfortunately, all seem to be afflicted by Google's apparent refusal to ""support"" ext4 - despite using ext4 for Android... I hope the ""move"" feature is straight-forward to implement. Alternatively, do you have any guidance for how I can accomplish this move?

termux/termux-app,open,"Termux slows down in ""doze mode"" (battery optimization) even with the wake lock",[],"This is not really a bug, but rather an ""improvement request"".

When Termux runs using the Wake Lock, the performance greatly slows down because of ""Doze"" (explained in details here: https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html)

> If a user leaves a device unplugged and stationary for a period of time, with the screen off, the device enters Doze mode. In Doze mode, the system attempts to conserve battery by restricting apps' access to network and CPU-intensive services. It also prevents apps from accessing the network and defers their jobs, syncs, and standard alarms.
> Periodically, the system exits Doze for a brief time to let apps complete their deferred activities. During this maintenance window, the system runs all pending syncs, jobs, and alarms, and lets apps access the network.
> As soon as the user wakes the device by moving it, turning on the screen, or connecting a charger, the system exits Doze and all apps return to normal activity

This means if you're connected with SSH on Termux, it will suddenly get really laggy (until you wake it up again), even worse if you use Termux as a web server.

See the conversation here: https://gitter.im/termux/termux?at=57a2253c836d2d0211610052

Termux has a pop-up error that states ""Termux was unable to install the bootstrap packages. Check your network connection and try again.""

termux/termux-app,open,Laggy backwards-scrolling in multiple applications,[],"I'm noticing that termux is very laggy when scrolling _backwards_ through applications.  This occurs both on local and remote (ssh'd _oot_ to other hosts) instances, which makes me suspect the issue is basic terminal functionality.

Example:

* Open Termux
* Open a large manpage using less as the pager.  The `bash` manpage is a good example.
* Skip to the end of the page (`G`).  From here:
* Single-line scrollback is relatively quick:  `k`
* Multi-line scrollback starts lagging:  `10k`
* A larger scrollback of 100 lines takes ~25 seconds:  `100k`
* Skipping to the top of the file sees a few seconds of lag, but not as much as the large scrollback:  `1G`

Vim noticeably _doesn't_ suffer from this (thankfully).  Pagers though do.

I'm looking to see if there's a way to access the Termux environment from another terminal to confirm my hunch.  The stock Android terminal environment cannot access the Termux files :(

termux/termux-app,open,Several Permission Issue when using python virtualenv and npm,[],"For npm issue, please see here https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17568.

**Virtualenv**

First, I `mkdir` a `Developer` directory under `/storage/emulated/0`, and then `link -s` it to termux home `~/storage/developer`. Then I tried to set up a virtualenv directory by using `virtualenv foo` but I got these permission errors:
```

When using termux on Android with Talkback running it is possible to review currently visible text on the screen by characters, by words and by lines.
It is possible to use two finger scrolling (android built-in feature) to scroll the view and access other parts of the text.

1. Start up Termux and ensure you are in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/

3. Create a file with `touch test` or edit and save a file using vim
4. `exit` out of su

**Expected behaviour**
File can be deleted/read/edited as non-root user.

""Permission denied"" occurs on any attempt to manipulate the file, including copying.

**Comments**
I tried `chmod 777` on first the file, and then on home/, and then tried `chown <user>` with no success. This bug doesn't happen in ~/storage/downloads.

termux/termux-app,open,Inconsistent touch response behavior within multiple pane screen session,[],"When running a newly created `screen` session with vertically and/or horizontally split panes, the touch screen can be used to select a pane within `screen`, but many touch screen interactions with command line programs (notably scrolling) do not function for programs such as `less` and `man` that are run inside of `screen` windows, even though such interactions work as expected when tested outside of `screen` (`emacs` is a notable exception; both cursor placement and scrolling function as expected for an `emacs` instance that's running inside of a `screen` window).

However, if a `screen` session is detached and then reattached, the touch screen interacts differently for both `screen` and the programs that are run inside of it. `screen` panes can no longer be selected with the touch screen (requiring the use of the C-a Tab key combo instead), but programs that are run within `screen` windows (`less`, `man`, etc.) appear to interact with the touch screen in the same way that they would if they were run outside of a `screen` session.  An exception to this generalization is the `bash` shell itself; while `bash` doesn't accept input from the touch screen when run outside of `screen`, a `bash` instance that is running inside of a reattached `screen` session seems to process movement across the touch screen as if presses of the arrow keys were being made.

I imagine that it might not be technically feasible to allow the touch screen's input to reliably affect both `screen` (through selecting window panes) and apps running inside of `screen` (through scrolling and other interactions) at the same time.  In any case, it may be desirable to adjust the behavior of `screen` in Termux such that the behavior of newly spawned `screen` sessions and newly attached `screen` sessions is the same in order to create a more consistent user experience.

In case it's of relevance, I quote my Termux environment's .inputrc below.  I have a few other environment files (including a .bashrc and .screenrc), but no others seem potentially related to this issue; let me know if you'd like to see any other files.

So far, that is the only key that I have tried and had any problems at all with.

The problem has caused some frustration on my end which is quite annoying:

* Going back to the start of a long line in the bash shell takes some time and I must start all over if I switch its command history with the nearby up or down keys.
* node interpreter (package nodejs) becomes a real annoyance because of the history does not save any changes like bash does... even temporairly. (I don't know if standard behavior.)"

Is it possible to implement something to preserve the filename?? 

For example, calling `termux-storage-getfile` without a destination filename, causes the script to create a file with the same name of the file that is selected in the popup and copies into it.

Even better if `termux-storage-getfile` is enhanced so it can select multiple files at once, instead of one at a time."

termux/termux-app,open,Use of usb serial port - e.g. Node.js/serialport/johnny five,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","tl;dr;
I have been attempting to use Node.js on termux to speak to a serial converter on a usb port (Tablet->OTG->USB->Arduino).  Have had a few issues with Node/Serial.  This is partly issue/potential planning for a pull (haven't done one before)

full version,
When trying to open the /dev/tty as per the node-serialport example

https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/node-serialport

var SerialPort = require('serialport');
var port = new SerialPort('/dev/tty-usbserial1', {
  baudRate: 57600
});

I tried ttySAC01 and a few others that were present in /dev but am getting 

Error: Error: Permission denied, cannot open /dev/ttySAC0
    at Error (native)

first line gives this
WARNING: linker: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/node-ardx/node_modules/serialport/build/Release/serialport.node has text relocations. This is wasting memory and prevents security hardening. Please fix.

I made a fork of termux-app and added this line to the AndroidManifest.xml

 <uses-feature android:name=""android.hardware.usb.host"" />

but as yet haven't had luck.

I know it's possible on android (non-rooted) through java (See https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android) and i found a C/JNI one too.  I looked at another option which creates a 'symlink' type tty device (pseudo tty) but this fails due to permissions also.  I've seen the minicom package - but not sure how it is used to connect to serial (i skimmed through the code but can't see where it hooks into serial)

Is this a matter of adding more permissions to termux? or would it involve more involve coding to make a pretend /dev device?  I figured it would be more usable to have it available through termux than building up a java app specifically for it.  Another use case is Node-RED.

termux/termux-app,open,Run Termux scripts from Android Debug Bridge [How to],"[Label(name=""information"")]","**Run Termux scripts from Android Debug Bridge**

If you want to run a Termux script from adb use one of the following methods:

**Method 1:**  
This method will run the script regardless of whether a Termux shell is already running not.  
However you have to allow adb root access on your phone.

```
adb shell am startservice -n com.termux/com.termux.app.TermuxService -a com.termux.service_execute -d /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/script.sh
```

The -d option is the path/script-name that you want to run.  

If you don't want to allow adb root access you can use the following:

**Method 2:**

```
adb shell am start -n com.termux/com.termux.app.TermuxActivity
adb shell input text '/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/script.sh'
adb shell input keyevent 66
```

The 1st line opens a Termux shell  
The 2nd line types in the path/script-name  
The 3rd line presses the enter key  

**Warning:** This method will bring to the forefront a Termux shell if one is currently running and use it. If it is not sitting at a waiting bash prompt, the script will not run.

If you want to kill any running Termux shells to insure that the script runs use the following:

```

The Pixel C keyboard has missing keys and a [...] key that the keyboard driver that can be used to compose these missing keys. The [...] key is on the location of the right-alt, and I believe that is the code being generated for this key.

Recently in v0.42 the keyboard shortcuts were changed from Ctrl+Shift to Ctrl+Alt for #145, but this breaks shortcuts I need in vi, namely Ctrl+], which I compose with Ctrl+[...]+p, which is now interpreted as Ctrl+Alt+p and is therefor capture by termux.

I would prefer the Ctrl+Shift back the way is was, but if that is not possible, ignore the right-alt key so I can still use Ctrl+<key> sequences. Possibly allow us to configure something? (apparently keyboard are tricky things)

The cursor does not natively blink, and Emacs can't _make_ it blink.

Also, the result of running `tput cnorm` and `tput cvvis` commands is identical, a rectangle cursor, when the first one is supposed to produce an underscore cursor, so something is very probably wrong.

This is kind of a problem in Emacs, because when background is used for highlighting _(i.e. on TODO items in org-mode)_ the block cursor can become completely invisible while over the highlighted text, and blinking cursor becomes a necessity.

i tyed to open the the conext menu on the android terminal emulator while a attached tmux session was generating a lot of output. it wasnt easy because conext menu got closed everytime (and that happened rappedly) when output changed. Just as i thought i made it ive got an app crash message. And not only that the terminal emulator crashed only, it crashed also all running tmux sessions and other not attached processes i had running in background.

So please do following fixes:
- make terminal emulator independent from processes started through it!!! ( i thought android had services for that...)
- fix that crash
- reimplement the context menu so it is also usable while output is generated rappedly
- maybe also add the context menu options to the side panel

termux/termux-app,closed,Home key on a bluetooth keyboard does not work,"[Label(name=""Keyboard""), Label(name=""bug report"")]","Thanks for making proper Linux on Android practical! Now it's just a matter of getting it all to work smoothly.

It took me a while to figure out why the escape key on my bluetooth keyboard isn't working, but once I found out that it's sending KeyCode 4, which is KEYCODE_BACK, I've been able to fix this through `termux.properties`.

But now I have another problem - the key for Home cursor move (Fn+Left) is not getting registered at all, (tested with `vtshowkeys`) even though it's sending keycode 122, which _should_ be MOVE_HOME. It is otherwise identical to the Left key _(same Meta State, same source, same keyboard type, the only thing different is the key code)_ so it should, in theory, work, but doesn't.

As a side note, External Keyboard Helper _(which I can't use to remap keys, since it completely borks Alt keys in Termux. I haven't been able to figure out why.)_ has one right idea: It is supposed to be capable of only reinterpreting keys if they come from an input device with an ID that is higher than a certain threshold. Hardware keys on the device itself typically come first, so you can have the back key on the device and the escape key on the keyboard at the same time. Could this possibly be implemented for the 'escape' setting in `termux.properties`?

termux/termux-app,open,Install packages to /system [feature request],"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","This may be a simple question, but since the installer is within the app, I figured I should ask it here. Termux is a wonderful app, and I use it almost on a daily basis. However, so often times I prefer to use the packages it provide from adb to manage my phone, and debug my own scripts and apps. I also prefer to use some other Terminal Emulator apps with Termux packages, rather than its own emulator. This is due to many reasons, such as being used to them, having more ready plugins, supporting tabs and easy style configuring.

I always use the solution provided [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/77) to do so, however I think this process could be more easy, and robust if other people use Termux with their own Terminal emulators.

My purpose is that Termux Installer should provide a way to install its binaries to the /system/bin or /system/xbin, if the device is rooted. Also, it needs to either install the libraries in the proper /system directory, and/or add the binary and library directories to the PATH so that using termux outside its emulator could be as easy typing `tmux` in the console.

Of course, installing to the /system should _not_ be enabled by default, and it should be done so only if the device has root access, and the user chooses to do so.

Please consider adding this, I think install the bin files to the /system/bin directory will be both useful, and make more sense to Linux devs. :)

### FolderSync

At night my phone is running a few [FolderSync](http://www.tacit.dk/foldersync) tasks. There aren't a lot of files to be synced, but it does check a lot of files. I've checked and FolderSync isn't using up Memory or CPU. 
### Jekyll

In the cases of it closing while I'm working with it, it has happened noticably more frequent when working with Jekyll, while Jekyll is generating the website.  
## Speculation

It seems to happen during times of high filesystem activity. Is it maybe related to a filesystem interrupt? Like a file that needs to be read by the app which it can't do because the filesystem is overloaded?

All this happens with or without Wakelock held. Termux isn't entirely closing, it just seems to loose the session. The following screenshot shows ""0 terminal sessions"" and the Wakelock isn't held. As far as I know, Termux should only show 0 Sessions when a Wakelock is held.

I also once made termux do a continous logcat until it closed. https://gist.github.com/Neo-Oli/faa32ecb939c1f88cbcd7748a8377600

So far, this has only happened on marhmallow phones. It first appeared the day after I upgraded from KitKat.

Sadly, I can't produce a reproducible test case that doesn't involve waiting for 12 hours. I'm hoping someone else has the same issue as me. I'd be willing to run any test builds or do any debugging I can.

termux/termux-app,closed,Expose files to external editors using Storage Access Framework,[],"I'd like to use Termux for git/compiling/executing, but prefer external Android editors for editing source code.

The obvious approach, of doing `git init` or `git clone` in `/sdcard` fails with:
`error: chmod on /storage/emulated/0/reponame/.git/config.lock failed: Operation not permitted`
(see https://plus.google.com/+LarsStokholm/posts/eZqMLNmKX1n and similar issue https://github.com/corbinlc/gnuroot/issues/55). It would be great to find a workaround for that, but it seems tricky.

So instead, how about making Termux's app-private storage available to other apps via a Storage Access Framework DocumentsProvider? For example with [Turbo Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maskyn.fileeditor) you can enable ""Use the Storage Access Framework"" from the right hand drawer, and then it uses the SAF to open files, and can subsequently save them to the same location. Not quite as flexible as making files available via the sdcard, but perhaps better than nothing?

As a side note, running `plugin.shell('getprop ro.build.version.sdk')` outputs `21` which means that ARC is emulating Android 5.0.

termux/termux-app,closed,I am stuck in Google's keyboard...,[],"This started about the time I bought the styling app, so I suppose there is a slight chance this is related. Google's keyboard lacks too many modifier, function, and arrow keys to be useful on a cli app like Termux. I have the hacker's keyboard set, and it works in all other apps; with the exception of Termux.

I am sorry for not reporting this sooner, but I've been setting up a new laptop. I am running on a 1st gen N7 rooted w/ cyanogenMod. 

I updated Termux/packages on an Identical N7 except 4 it's stock rooted, w/o the styling app; and it's Termux still picks up the Hacker's Keyboard just fine.

I am going to try w/o the styling app, and see if that helps. I might also try wiping the app cache 4 Termux. If these steps fail I will try a backup/reinstall of Termux.

I'll report back if anything I can come up w/ works.

https://plus.google.com/u/0/105143408064070053742/posts/SckNbhF6RQY
I was busy with other stuffs so I had made a quick post there hoping someone would chime in..  great to know that issues I wanted to report with C++ linking and play-audio have been resolved already.

Anyways back to current issue, programs that write a lot of output to terminal freezes app. I investigated it a bit and it doesnt happen if the write is limited..

Here's a test case..
Run a program that writes to terminal
`find $PREFIX/lib`
The terminal will output until a new line and freeze until the command completes.

Now limit the output with pv.
`apt install pv`
 `find $PREFIX/lib | pv -L 2048`
The output will be scrolled too fast to read in the terminal but it doesnt freeze the app.

termux/termux-app,open,Add support for mouse gestures. ,"[Label(name=""enhancement"")]","In certain programs you can use mouse gestures to do various tasks, for example:
- tmux lets you resize panes with click and drag.
- weechat has swipe left and right gestures to switch buffer. 

This works when connecting to termux via SSH from a computer with mouse but it does not work when using the termux app. 
I realize that this would cause a conflict with the swipe to scroll feature, but maybe we can come up with a solution that can incorporate both these features. 
Some ways I came up with: 
- Move the long press menu into the left side drawer and have long press function as a click and drag. 
- Have a switch (or one time function like select) in the long press menu to switch between click and drag and scroll. In the two programs I came across with mouse dragging it is not something you have to do all the time, so having an additional step between might not be that bad. 

Maybe someone has a better idea?

```
clear

printf ""\033[3r"" # Top scroll margin to 3.
printf ""\033[2T"" # Scroll down.
read
reset
```

This should leave the screen containing

```
1
2


3
4
5
```

due to the scroll margin protecting the top two lines.

One program that is affected is `htop`, which (with a long enough list of processes relative to the terminal) sets the top margin to protect the upper CPU usage area before scrolling the list below, causing garbled display in Termux. This was reported in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/86.

termux/termux-app,closed,Google Pixel C Keyboard Escape key handling,[],"Hi,

I have recently (naturally) aquired a Pixel C with the Pixel C Keyboard. Almost everything seems to be working, there is just an annoyance preventing me from using termux fully.
Since they Pixel C Keyboard is missing keys, there are build-in [hotkeys](https://support.google.com/pixel/answer/6326992?hl=en) for the missing ones. However:

If I press the ![...](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FS30qf3hlMsphqXMswSDwRgvOnHTBOG0Tnip2Gb5hnNOvW6VkKf8u6jL1zJBmMG8vvJi=w18-rwa)+1 key that maps to escape I _also_ get the extended-keys soft-keyboard. It makes vi quite frustrating to use :)

I believe this is an issue with termux because:
- other programs I tried to not have this behaviour
- termux does not have this behavour with other keys like [ or ] that are also not present as physical keys.
- escape keys are funny with terminals :)

pip2 install mercurial

It works! But then:

```

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, if it is Termux bug, Mercurial's, or if the fix would be a Mercurial package. Any help please?

It will be good if there be any UI for changing cursor in Termux. It's very annoying to press vol button for simulating `ctrl` key for changing direction (if you have worked with nano you know what I'm saying).

Or it can be simple direction arrow in app or Termux be able to change cursor position on touch.

thank you.
