A possible solution: For each `${FONT}.ttf` make it possible to create a file `${FONT}.txt` containing license and attribution (and probably a link to the creator site). Likewise for `${COLORTHEME}.properties` (or have the license/attribution inline as a property for themes). Then make a long press on a font or theme show the license/attribution with hyperlinks.

Thoughts?"

As of Android 6.0 this also happens if the `~/.termux/` directory is symlinked to somewhere on the sdcard. Probably because Termux:Styling doesn't ask for storage permissions.

termux/termux-styling,closed,Solarized Light style incorrectly reverses light/dark colors,[],"The Solarized Light style (`solarized-light.properties`) incorrectly reverses light/dark accent colors. In particular, `color0` - `color15` should be _identical_ between the light and dark variants of the color scheme, with the only changes being to the foreground and background colors.

An easy way to see this is to use the official ViM Solarized color scheme (or any of the other variants out there); colors are currently only displayed correctly for Termux's Solarized Light style when ViM's `background` is set to `dark` (opposite of what it should be).

The attached zip file contains a version of the Solarized Light style that should fix this issue, as well as a patch between the old and new file (if so desired).
