anselm94/Torchie-Android,open,volume button triggers do not work on Android 8.1 DP1,[],Torchie's volume button trigger does not work when running Android 8.1 Developer Preview 1 on Google Pixel or Google Pixel 2 XL. 
anselm94/Torchie-Android,open,Use timeout when waiting for second Vol button action,[],"Torchie turns on when I press both Vol buttons at once.
Though, 'at once' rarely is true, there's always a tiny delay between the two button actions.

Which turns out to be feature, because to toggle your LED:
you can slide over the Vol rocker in any direction
you can press/release both buttons discretely one after the other, which increases accessibility IMO

..but also a bug:
on my device, Torchie appears to wait more than 2min for that second button press, and the LED turned on unnoticed in my pocket quite a few times...and sometimes I could not toggle the LED afterwards

Reproduce:
make sure Torchie is turned off
lock screen, screen off
press `Vol +`
wait up to 2 minutes
press `Vol -`
> LED turns on

I think a timeout of a few seconds would fix the bug and also keep the accessibility feature.

anselm94/Torchie-Android,closed,v3.0 build errors on F-Droid,[],"v3.0 [fails](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/in.blogspot.anselmbros.torchie/lastbuild_28) to build on F-Droid. Steps to reproduce: run `gradle assembleRelease`.

First issue is that `com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.0` is available in the new Google Maven repo, not JCenter. Solution: add `google()` to the `repositories` sections of the root `build.gradle`.

Second issue is failing `lintVitalRelease` task: `Error: Non-translatable resources should only be defined in the base values/ folder`. Solution: fix those errors _or_ disable them (add `checkReleaseBuilds false` into `build.gradle`) _or_ make them non-fatal (add `abortOnError false` into `build.gradle`)."
