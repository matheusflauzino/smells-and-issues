Tortel/SysLog,open,Syslog Play Store Description: ADB Permission Option for Non-root Devices Missing,[],"Even more people could enjoy [Syslog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog) if the app description in Play Store would include the adb set permission option.

This worked perfectly on un-rooted S5 Mini G800H & S5 G900M both running Android stock 6.0.1 and S5 G900M running LineageOS 15.1:

adb shell pm grant com.tortel.syslog android.permission.READ_LOGS

User review by Shahab Jafri in your Play page also mentions it.

You could check the example of [BetterBatteryStats](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asksven.betterbatterystats) > Unrooted devices chapter & it's [BBS unrooted devices FAQ page](http://better.asksven.org/nonroot-devices/) for inspiration.

Thanks for implementing the [issue 21](https://github.com/Tortel/SysLog/issues/21) suggestion.

_Edit:_ the screen captures also need to be updated. Current in Play page vs. Syslog 2.1.6:

Tortel/SysLog,closed,Add Proper Log's Name in the App Please,[],"I like to recommend Syslog in different forums to newbies because it makes sharing logs for troubleshooting so much easier for them but it's a pain to explain every time that Kernel log = dmesg, Last kernel log= last_kmsg, main log = logcat.

So why not add in parenthesis **in the app itself** the actual real log's name output like what you did in the [Syslog description in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tortel.syslog&hl=en)?

> * Kernel logs (dmsg)
    * Last kernel log (last_kmsg, if device supports it)
    * Main log (Logcat)

Anyway thank you for this awesome app & for keeping it up-to-date.

Tortel/SysLog,closed,Adapting SysLog into a service to run in background,[],"Hi

I'm working on adapting your sysLog code in to a simple app that launch a background services to collect the system log and send it back to the app and to remote server.
But I don't know where to collect the system log, I´m looking into the LiveLogActivity.class that inside has the LiveLogFragment (extend from Fragment) but they need an Activity to work... (onCreateView) 
I think the mTermSession is getting the data but again it works with and Activity...

so there is any simple way to get the log data from a services without need of an Activity?

thanks in advance."
Tortel/SysLog,closed,Stuck on Working,[],"When I try to take log, even just for the Kernel it gets stuck on the Working screen."
Tortel/SysLog,open,Live logcat coloring,[],"I somewhat remember to have seen the live logs in color. However, as I started SysLog just now, the live logs were just black and white.

Is this expected to be like that? Perhaps I saw it on a different app, although I can't remember which it could have been.

And if expected, are there any chances to get the coloring added?

Thanks"
Tortel/SysLog,closed,Cannot take log,[],"I have a bug when I take log, directory is not created and logs are not saved.

I think the problem lies in Utils.java, you should use

`if(!outPath.mkdirs() || !outPath.isDirectory()){`

instead of

`if(!outPath.mkdirs() && !outPath.isDirectory()){`

Thanks for your very useful app.

On many devices this contains a log of SELinux audit failures that may not be present in logcat and/or dmesg output, and can be very handy to help diagnose issues related to security for root apps.
